Below you will find examples of questions and their QDMRs found in Break.   
Note that *high-level* QDMRs are less coarse in their decomposition, as they are geared towards reading comprehension tasks. For more details on *high-level* QDMRs please refer to [our paper](https://allenai.github.io/Break/#paper).
