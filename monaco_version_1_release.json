Over the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt. Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts. Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams. The newly introduced doublet and the quilted and padded jupe or gipon were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic. The sleeveless surcoat or cyclas was introduced as protective covering for armour. Rectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic, fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front. As headgear, the chaperon in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn, as well as the fitted linen coif tied under the chin. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer."

One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head, where the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a garnache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardecorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A mantle was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, shoes, and headdress. Men wore long braies or leggings with legs of varying length. Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the beret, the coif (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat, and a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders.

Over the shirt was worn a doublet, very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, with the sleeves being full and even puffy. Men wore short braies or breeches, a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt. Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored. As doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the codpiece. The Houppelande, or cioppa, was the overgarment of the wealthy, it was a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ-pipe pleats and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor. A sideless tunic or tabard, called a giornea or journade was popular. For headgear, the hood remained popular, although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into a chaperon. Hats began to compete with the chaperon. Hats of vaious styles: tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all, hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif, or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front. For footwear the duckbill shoe and long-toed poulaines were popular."
