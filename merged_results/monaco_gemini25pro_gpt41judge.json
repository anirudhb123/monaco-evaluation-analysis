The drama revolves around the marriage of Nora and Torvald Helmer.\n\n2.  ***The Wild Duck***: The plot centers on the Ekdal family. The story is driven by the revelation that the marriage between the protagonists, Hjalmar Ekdal and his wife Gina, is \"built on a lie\" arranged by the wealthy merchant H√•kon Werle (Document 56).\n\n3.  ***The Lady from the Sea***: The play is centered on the married couple Ellida and Doctor Wangel. The main conflict is Ellida's choice between her husband and a former lover, which is resolved when Wangel grants her freedom to choose, and she chooses to stay with him to \"take up their lives again together\" (Documents 8, 9).\n\n4.  ***Little Eyolf***: This play \"tells the story of the Allmers family\" (Document 11), focusing on the married couple Alfred and Rita. Following the tragic death of their son, they blame each other for his past injury and confront the deep-seated problems in their marriage, ultimately deciding to stay together to \"atone for their mistakes\" (Documents 13, 14).\n\n5.  ***When We Dead Awaken***: The play opens with the sculptor Arnold Rubek and his wife Maia, a married couple expressing their unhappiness and disappointment with their life together (Document 16).

They were allies, not enemies.\n*   **Peruvian Civil War of 1843‚Äì1844 (Document 2):** This was an internal conflict between two Peruvian factions: the \"Directoriales (government)\" and the \"Provisional Junta (constitutionalists).\"\n*   **Huaraz Rebellion (Document 3):** This was an internal conflict between the government of Peru and \"Quechua Rebels.\"\n*   **Peruvian War of Independence (Document 4):** This war was fought to gain independence from the \"Spanish Empire.\" While neighboring countries like Colombia and Chile were co-belligerents on the same side as Peru, the enemy was Spain, not a neighboring country.\n*   **Salaverry-Santa Cruz War (Document 5):** This conflict is described as a war between two Peruvian factions, the \"Pro-Confederation\" side and the \"Anti-Confederation\" side. While neighboring countries were involved (Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, a leader of the pro-confederation side, was from Bolivia, and the anti-confederation side was supported by Argentina and Chile), the document frames it as an internal war between Peruvian groups (\"Salaverristas\" and \"Gamarristas\" vs. \"Orbegosistas\" and \"Santa Crucistas\").",

      "llm_response": "Based on the documents provided, here are the popular hairstyles for women for each decade from the 1900s to the 1990s:\n\n### 1900s\nMasses of wavy hair were fashionable. The hair was swept up to the top of the head over horsehair pads called \"rats\" and gathered into a knot (Document 4).\n\n### 1910s\nThere is no information about women's hairstyles in the 1910s in the provided documents.\n\n### 1920s\nWomen \"bobbed,\" or cut their hair short, which was considered a radical move at the beginning of the decade but became standard by the end. This was done to fit under the popular close-fitting cloche hats (Document 9).\n\n### 1930s\nThere is no information about women's hairstyles in the 1930s in the provided documents.\n\n### 1940s\n*   **Victory rolls** were a popular hairstyle from 1940 to 1945. The style is characterized by voluminous curls of hair on top of the head or framing the face and is associated with the pin-up look (Document 5).\n*   After the war, women began to wear their hair in softer, more natural styles (Document 7).\n\n### 1950s\n*   **Early 1950s:** Women's hair was generally curled and worn in a variety of styles and lengths (Document 7).\n*   **Later 1950s:** High bouffant and beehive styles became popular (Document 7).\n*   **Teenage Girls:** Commonly wore their hair in ponytails (Document 10).\n\n### 1960s\nWomen's hairstyles in the 1960s were varied and ranged between several extremes:\n*   **Early 1960s:** Beehive hairdos were popular (Document 6).\n*   **Influential Styles:** Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffant hairstyle was a significant trend (Document 6).\n*   **Mid-decade Styles:** The chin-length contour cut and the pageboy were also popular (Document 6).\n*   **Later 1960s:** Very short styles, like the pixie cut popularized by Twiggy and Mia Farrow, and very long, straight hair, popularized by the hippie movement, were fashionable (Documents 6, 7).\n\n### 1970s\n*   **Early 1970s:** Hair was often long, loose, and straight (Documents 7, 11). Women achieved this look through chemical straightening or by ironing their hair at home (Document 7).\n*   **Later 1970s:** The feathery cut, as popularized by Farrah Fawcett, became a trend (Document 11).\n*   **Punk Subculture:** The Mohawk hairstyle was associated with the punk subculture (Documents 7, 11).\n\n### 1980s\nThe 1980s were typified by large, voluminous hair:\n*   **General Styles:** Large hair-dos, puffed-up styles, permanent waves (perms), and softer cuts were common. Big hair, often permed for volume, is strongly associated with the decade (Document 13).\n*   **Perms:** The perm hairstyle, which created soft, full curls, was popular. By the late 1980s, the permed bouffant became highly fashionable (Document 8).\n*   **Bouffant:** High-volume bouffants, popularized by TV shows like *Dynasty*, were a glamorous look (Document 13).\n*   **Color:** In the last half of the decade, many young women dyed their hair rich burgundy or plum-red (Document 8).\n\n### 1990s\n*   **Early 1990s:** The big, curly styles from the 1980s continued. The poofy \"mall bangs\" style was also prominent (Document 1).\n*   **Throughout the Decade:** High and high-sided ponytails were popular, especially for sports. They were worn with a scrunchie in the first half of the decade and later with hair ties (Document 1).\n*   **Bangs:** Big bangs remained popular throughout the 1990s, though they became smaller and flatter after 1994 (Document 1).",

The question concerns the ruling dynasties before this date.\n\n2.  **Rulers After the Fatimids:** The dynasty that immediately succeeded the Fatimids in ruling Egypt was the Ayyubid dynasty, established by Saladin in 1171 (Documents 8 and 10).\n\n3.  **Ethnicity of the Ayyubid Dynasty:** The Ayyubid dynasty was not ethnically Arab. Document 8 specifies that Northern Kurdish was the language of the \"Ruling dynasty, Aristocracy, Military oligarchy,\" indicating the Ayyubids were of Kurdish origin.\n\n4.  **Ethnicity of the Fatimid Caliphate:** The Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled before the Ayyubids, was an ethnically Arab dynasty. Document 10 states, \"The Fatimids trace their ancestry to the Islamic prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatima and her husband Ali, the first Shia imam.\" This lineage establishes them as an Arab dynasty. They made Egypt the center of their caliphate and ruled from Cairo from 973 until 1171 (Document 10).\n\nSince the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty and subsequent rulers (Mamluks, Ottomans, and the Alawiyya dynasty) came after the Fatimids, the Fatimid Caliphate was the last ethnically Arab dynasty to rule Egypt.",

This led to the conquest of England, where the invading Normans and their descendants replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class and established themselves as the new kings of England (Documents 3, 4).\n\n*   **The Kingdom of Sicily:** The Norman conquest of southern Italy occurred between 999 and 1194. In 1130, these conquered territories, which included the southern third of the Italian Peninsula and the island of Sicily, were united to form the Kingdom of Sicily (Document 2).\n\n*   **Cyprus:** In 1191, an Anglo-Norman fleet led by Richard the Lion-hearted conquered the island of Cyprus. After the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos, refused to release prisoners and treasure, Richard's forces landed and took the port of Limassol (Document 7).\n\n*   **The Canary Islands:** Between 1402 and 1405, an expedition led by the Norman noble Jean de Bethencourt conquered the islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, and El Hierro off the coast of Africa (Document 8).\n\nAdditionally, the documents note an \"Anglo-Norman invasion\" of Ireland, which at the time was divided into many \"petty kingships\" (Document 5). However, the documents state that English rule did not extend over the entire island until the much later Tudor conquest in the 16th-17th centuries.

      "llm_response": "Based on the documents provided, the national dishes of Algeria are not keto diet friendly. Here is a breakdown of why:\n\n**1. National Dishes of Algeria:**\nAccording to Document 1, the national dishes of Algeria are couscous and rechta.\n\n**2. The Ketogenic Diet:**\nThe ketogenic (keto) diet is a \"high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate\" diet (Document 6). The premise of the diet is to deprive the body of glucose from carbohydrate foods, forcing it to burn fat for energy instead (Documents 6 and 7). Foods high in carbohydrates, such as potatoes, are excluded (Document 5).\n\n**3. Analysis of Algerian National Dishes:**\n\n*   **Couscous:** The primary ingredient of couscous is \"small steamed granules of rolled semolina\" (Document 2). Semolina is a high-carbohydrate grain, which is not compatible with a low-carbohydrate keto diet.\n*   **Rechta:** Rechta is a dish \"made from pasta cut into thin fresh artisan strips\" (Document 3). The pasta is typically made from \"semolina flour and water\" (Document 4). Like couscous, its main component is a high-carbohydrate food. Furthermore, common variations of rechta include ingredients like chickpeas and potatoes (Document 4), with potatoes being explicitly excluded from a classic keto diet (Document 5).\n\nIn conclusion, both of Algeria's national dishes, couscous and rechta, are centered around high-carbohydrate ingredients (semolina, pasta) and may include other non-keto-friendly items like potatoes, making them unsuitable for a ketogenic diet.",

        "Yam bai cha",
        "Yam hua pli thot",
        "Yam khai dao"
      ],
      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, most Thai salads are not vegetarian-friendly due to the frequent inclusion of meat, seafood, fish sauce, or shrimp paste. Vegetarianism is defined as abstaining from meat, poultry, and seafood (Document 6). Many Thai salad dressings, particularly for `yam` and `som tam` styles, contain non-vegetarian ingredients.\n\nHowever, a few salads have main ingredients that are vegetarian, though their standard preparation may not be. The following salads can be considered potentially vegetarian-friendly, with important caveats based on the documents:\n\n### **Potentially Vegetarian-Friendly Salads:**\n\n**1. Tam makhuea** (Eggplant Salad)\nThis salad is the most likely candidate to be vegetarian-friendly, although the documents provide conflicting descriptions:\n*   **Vegetarian Description:** Document 1 describes it as made from \"Chopped and then pounded grilled long green eggplant (makhuea yao; Thai: ‡∏°‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ß), grilled green chili peppers, raw garlic and salt put in a banana leaf package mixed together with hard-boiled egg.\" This recipe does not contain meat or seafood, making it friendly for ovo-vegetarians (vegetarians who eat eggs).\n*   **Non-Vegetarian Description:** Document 4 states that the northern Thai `tam makhuea` is made from \"mashed grilled eggplant, grilled shallots and garlic, roasted chillies, **fish, and shrimp paste** and served with mint and boiled egg,\" which is not vegetarian.\n\n**2. Yam khai dao** (Fried Egg Salad)\nThe main ingredient is fried egg, which is suitable for ovo-vegetarians. However, this is a `yam`-style salad. According to Document 26, \"the basic recipe of a yam will nearly always contain sliced fresh shallots or onions, **fish sauce**, lime juice, sugar, and fresh or dried chillies.\" Therefore, while the main component is vegetarian, the dressing typically is not.\n\n**3. Yam hua pli thot** (Fried Banana Blossom Salad)\nThis salad's main ingredient is deep-fried banana blossom (Document 1). As a \"yam-style salad,\" it would likely be prepared with the standard `yam` dressing that includes fish sauce (Document 26), making it not vegetarian-friendly in its typical form.\n\n**4. Tam maphrao on sen mi krop** (Young Coconut Salad)\nThis is a \"som tam style salad made with the meat of a young coconut\" (Document 1). While the main ingredient is vegetarian, \"som tam style\" dressings often contain non-vegetarian ingredients. For example, the dressing for `Tam phonlamai ruam` (mixed fruit salad) is described as similar to that of `som tam` and includes **dried shrimp** and **fish sauce** (Document 1). Similarly, Document 3 lists **dried shrimp, fish sauce, shrimp paste,** and **fish paste** as common additional ingredients for Green Papaya Salad (`Som tam`).\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, **Tam makhuea** is the only salad described with a recipe that can be considered vegetarian-friendly (specifically, ovo-vegetarian), although a conflicting document suggests otherwise. Other salads with vegetarian main ingredients like `Yam khai dao`, `Yam hua pli thot`, and `Tam maphrao on sen mi krop` are unlikely to be vegetarian in their standard preparation due to the common use of fish sauce or other seafood products in their dressings.",

It is a collection of stories told by \"a group of pilgrims as they travel together from London to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral\" (Document 7). The pilgrimage itself is a religious journey.\n\n*   **Boece (translation of *On the Consolation of Philosophy*)**: This work, translated by Chaucer, directly engages with major religious and theological questions. The text \"reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of theodicy), and how happiness is still attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God\" (Document 8).\n\n*   **Parlement of Foules**: This poem contains several religious and philosophical elements. The narrator is guided through \"celestial spheres\" to a gate promising a \"welle of grace,\" and the poem explores the theme of \"free will,\" a significant theological concept (Document 6). It also features the pagan goddess Venus and her temple.\n\n*   **The Book of the Duchess**: This poem includes pagan religious elements. A central character, Alcyone, \"prays to the goddess Juno to send her a dream vision\" (Document 4).\n\n*   **The House of Fame**: In this work, Chaucer \"writes an invocation to the god of sleep,\" which is a form of prayer to a pagan deity (Document 5).\n\n*   **The Legend of Good Women**: The prologue of this poem features the \"god of love and his queen, Alceste,\" who command Chaucer to write the book (Document 9).\n\n*   **The Romaunt of the Rose (translation)**: In this allegorical dream-vision, the narrator \"receives advice from the god of love on gaining his lady's favor\" (Document 3).",

Several player-team-position combinations do not match the correct_answer.

      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, the percentage of incumbent British ministers who went to either Oxford or Cambridge is 100%.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Identifying the Incumbent Ministers\n\nThe documents list several ministers who served under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. To be considered \"incumbent\" for this question, a minister must have held a role that concluded on July 5, 2024, which marks the end of that administration.\n\nBased on this criterion, the following 14 individuals from the documents are identified as incumbent ministers:\n\n1.  **Rishi Sunak:** Prime Minister (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 6)\n2.  **Oliver Dowden:** Deputy Prime Minister (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 15)\n3.  **Jeremy Hunt:** Chancellor of the Exchequer (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 7)\n4.  **Michael Gove:** Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 8)\n5.  **Alex Chalk:** Secretary of State for Justice (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 3)\n6.  **Steve Barclay:** Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 17)\n7.  **Mark Harper:** Secretary of State for Transport (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 1)\n8.  **Mel Stride:** Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 2)\n9.  **Victoria Prentis:** Attorney General (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 12)\n10. **Andrew Mitchell:** Deputy Foreign Secretary (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 14)\n11. **John Glen:** Minister for the Cabinet Office (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 5)\n12. **Greg Hands:** Minister of State for Trade Policy (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 10)\n13. **Tom Tugendhat:** Minister of State for Security (in office until July 5, 2024) (Document 11)\n14. **Lucy Frazer:** The provided document is titled \"Lucy Frazer\" and lists her education, implying her relevance as an incumbent minister. (Document 9)\n\n*Note: Suella Braverman, Jeremy Quin, and Robert Jenrick are excluded as their ministerial roles under Rishi Sunak ended in 2023, before the end of the government's term.*\n\n### 2. Alma Mater of Each Incumbent Minister\n\nOut of the 14 incumbent ministers identified, all 14 attended either Oxford or Cambridge University.\n\n*   **Attended Oxford University (7 ministers):**\n    *   **Rishi Sunak:** Lincoln College, Oxford (Document 6)\n    *   **Jeremy Hunt:** Magdalen College, Oxford (Document 7)\n    *   **Michael Gove:** Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (Document 8)\n    *   **Alex Chalk:** Magdalen College, Oxford (Document 3)\n    *   **Mark Harper:** Brasenose College, Oxford (Document 1)\n    *   **Mel Stride:** St Edmund Hall, Oxford (Document 2)\n    *   **John Glen:** Mansfield College, Oxford (and also Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge) (Document 5)\n\n*   **Attended Cambridge University (7 ministers):**\n    *   **Oliver Dowden:** Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Document 15)\n    *   **Steve Barclay:** Peterhouse, Cambridge (Document 17)\n    *   **Victoria Prentis:** Downing College, Cambridge (Document 12)\n    *   **Andrew Mitchell:** Jesus College, Cambridge (Document 14)\n    *   **Greg Hands:** Robinson College, Cambridge (Document 10)\n    *   **Tom Tugendhat:** Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (Document 11)\n    *   **Lucy Frazer:** Newnham College, Cambridge (Document 9)\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\n*   **Total number of incumbent ministers:** 14\n*   **Number of incumbent ministers who attended Oxford or Cambridge:** 14\n\n**Percentage:** (14 √∑ 14) * 100 = **100%**",

This is well within the 50-year timeframe.\n    *   **Liberal Democrats** (3,519,143 votes) were founded on March 3, 1988 (Document 18), which is also within the 50-year timeframe.\n    *   **Green Party of England and Wales** (1,841,888 votes) has its roots in the PEOPLE Party, which was started in 1972/3 (Document 8), placing its origin before the 1974 cut-off.\n    *   **Scottish National Party** (724,758 votes) was founded in 1934 (Document 7).\n\n4.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   Comparing the two highest-polling parties founded after 1974, Reform UK received 4,117,620 votes, and the Liberal Democrats received 3,519,143 votes (Document 51).\n    *   Therefore, Reform UK received the most votes among all parties that did not exist 50 years prior to the 2024 election.",

This was the first time the prime minister was directly elected on a separate ballot (Document 2). In that election, Netanyahu's opponent and the runner-up was Shimon Peres of the Labor party.

Although the Kadima party, led by Tzipi Livni, won the most seats, Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud party was able to form a majority coalition government and become prime minister (Document 3, Document 9).\n\n3.  **Third Election (2013): Yair Lapid**\n    *   Netanyahu was elected for his third term following the 2013 legislative election (Document 1).

      ],
      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, **22.7%** of the American Civil War battles listed were fought outside the territory of the Confederate States.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Defining Confederate Territory\nThe Confederate States of America (CSA) was composed of 11 states that seceded from the Union: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia (Document 449). Battles that took place in what is now West Virginia before its admission to the Union in 1863 are counted as being within Virginia, a Confederate state (e.g., Document 8, Document 15).\n\n### 2. Total Number of Battles\nThe documents list a total of 455 engagements. However, the New York City Draft Riots (Document 107, Document 2) are excluded from the battle count as this was a civil disturbance rather than a direct military conflict between the USA and CSA.

The specific catalyst was Britain gathering allies to form the Third Coalition in response to Napoleon declaring himself emperor of France (Document 2, Document 11).\n\n*   **War of the Fourth Coalition (1806):** The war was sparked by Prussia's growing indignation over French interference in German affairs, particularly through the Confederation of the Rhine. The \"final spark\" was the arrest and execution of the German nationalist Johann Philipp Palm in August 1806 for publishing a pamphlet attacking Napoleon. After this, Prussia issued an ultimatum to Napoleon on October 1, 1806, and then went to war (Document 10).\n\n*   **Peninsular War (1807-1814):** The war began in 1807 when French and Spanish armies invaded and occupied Portugal. The conflict \"escalated in 1808 after Napoleonic France occupied Spain,\" which had previously been its ally. Napoleon forced the Spanish rulers to abdicate and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the throne, prompting most Spaniards to reject French rule and fight back (Document 5).\n\n*   **French Invasion of Russia (1812):** Napoleon initiated this war to force the Russian Empire to comply with the \"continental blockade of the United Kingdom\" (Document 6). Another central issue was a dispute over Poland; both Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I wanted to control a semi-independent Poland, which is described as \"the root cause\" of the war (Document 13).\n\n*   **War of the Seventh Coalition (1815):** This conflict, also known as the Hundred Days, began after Napoleon returned from his exile on the island of Elba. In response, the Great Powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw on March 13, 1815.

These include:\n    *   The ƒê√° V√°ch rebellion (1803‚Äì1885) by ethnic minorities (Document 2).\n    *   Phan B√° V√†nh's rebellion (1821‚Äì1827) (Document 2).\n    *   Rebellions by the Chams people, such as those led by Ja Lidong (1822-1823) and Ja Thak Wa and Katip Sumat (1833-1835) (Document 2).\n    *   N√¥ng VƒÉn V√¢n's Rebellion (1833-1835) by northern ethnic minorities (Documents 1, 2, 3).\n    *   L√™ VƒÉn Kh√¥i's revolt (1833‚Äì1835) (Documents 1, 2).\n    *   Cao B√° Qu√°t's rebellion (1854‚Äì1856) (Documents 1, 2).\n    *   The C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement (1885‚Äì1896) (Document 5).\n    *   The Y√™n Th·∫ø Insurrection (1884‚Äì1913) (Documents 1, 5).\n    *   The August Revolution (1945), which ultimately led to the end of the dynasty (Documents 1, 6).\n\nIn terms of external enemies, the two most frequent were **Siam** and **France**:\n\n*   **Siam (Rattanakosin Kingdom)**: The Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty engaged in several conflicts with Siam, often over influence in Cambodia and Laos. These include:\n    *   Supporting opposing factions in Cambodian rebellions (1811‚Äì1812 and 1840‚Äì1841) (Document 2).\n    *   The Lao rebellion against Siam, supported by the Nguy·ªÖn (1826‚Äì1828) (Document 2).\n    *   The Siamese‚ÄìVietnamese War (1831‚Äì1834) (also listed as Vi·ªát Nam-Siam War 1833-1834) (Documents 1, 2).\n    *   The ƒê·∫°i Nam‚ÄìSiam War (1841‚Äì1845) (Documents 1, 2).\n\n*   **France**: France became a major adversary in the second half of the 19th century, leading to the colonization of Vietnam. Key conflicts include:\n    *   The Cochinchina campaign (1858‚Äì1862), which resulted in the loss of southern territories (Documents 1, 2, 4).\n    *   The Tonkin expedition (1873‚Äì1874) (Document 2).\n    *   The Tonkin campaign (1883‚Äì1886), which resulted in Vietnam becoming a French protectorate (Documents 1, 2).\n    *   The Sino-French War (1884-1885), where the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty was allied with the Qing against France (Document 5).\n\nIn conclusion, while Siam and France were significant and recurring foreign enemies, the sheer volume of internal conflicts, with over 400 separate rebellions recorded in just the first 60 years of the dynasty, makes **internal rebels** the most frequent enemy of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty.",

      "question": "Which 2 countries, bordering Hungary, has Hungary had the most armed conflicts against?",
      "gold_answers": [
        "Holy Roman Empire",
        "Wallachia"
      ],
      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, the two countries bordering Hungary against which Hungary has had the most armed conflicts are **Austria** and **Romania**.\n\nThis conclusion is reached by counting the distinct wars, campaigns, and uprisings listed across the documents, and grouping the historical entities with their modern-day counterparts that border Hungary.\n\n### 1. Austria\nHungary has had a long and frequent history of conflict with the Germanic power to its west, which is modern-day Austria. These conflicts were against various predecessor states and ruling houses:\n*   **Early Middle Ages:** Conflicts against **East Francia**, the **Kingdom of Germany**, and the **Holy Roman Empire** were numerous during the 9th and 10th centuries, including the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, subsequent invasions of Europe, and culminating in the Battle of Lechfeld (Document 1).\n*   **High and Late Middle Ages:** Wars continued against the **Holy Roman Empire**, the **Duchy of Bavaria**, and the **Duchy of Austria** (Document 1), as well as a major conflict in the late 15th century, the Austrian-Hungarian War (1482-1488), where King Matthias Corvinus captured Vienna (Document 2).\n*   **Habsburg Era:** After the Habsburg dynasty ascended to the Hungarian throne, numerous major conflicts were internal rebellions or wars of independence fought by Hungarians against the central Habsburg power based in Austria. These include **Bocskai's War of Independence** (1604‚Äì1606), the **Th√∂k√∂ly Uprising** (1678‚Äì1685) (Document 3), **R√°k√≥czi's War for Independence** (1703‚Äì1711), and the **Hungarian Revolution of 1848** (Document 4).\n*   **20th Century:** Minor conflicts occurred after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, such as the **Bruck an der Leitha raid** in 1919 and the **Uprising in West Hungary** in 1921 over the territory of Burgenland (Document 5).\n\n### 2. Romania\nHungary has also engaged in a high number of armed conflicts with states and peoples located in the territory of modern-day Romania. These include:\n*   **Middle Ages:** Conflicts against the medieval principalities of **Wallachia** and **Moldavia** were frequent. Notable examples include the Battle of Posada in 1330 against Wallachia and numerous campaigns by King Louis the Great and King Sigismund to assert Hungarian suzerainty (Document 2). Hungary also fought a war against Moldavia in 1467 (Document 2).\n*   **Early Modern Period:** The **Principality of Transylvania**, often acting as a semi-independent state, frequently fought against Royal (Habsburg) Hungary. This included its role in the Hungarian Civil War (1526-1538) as the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and its participation in conflicts like the Thirty Years' War on the side opposing the Habsburgs (Document 3). There were also internal conflicts within Transylvania, such as the Transylvanian peasant revolt of 1437 (Document 2) and the Revolt of Horea, Clo»ôca and Cri»ôan in 1784 (Document 4).\n*   **19th and 20th Centuries:** During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Hungarian forces fought against Transylvanian Romanian rebels who sided with the Habsburgs (Document 4, 88). In the 20th century, Hungary fought against the Kingdom of **Romania** in **World War I** (1916-1918), the **Hungarian-Romanian War** (1918-1919), and again in **World War II** after Romania joined the Allies in 1944 (Document 5, 12).",

      ],
      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, a total of **47** parties in the recent federal elections had less than a 2.5 point difference between their popular vote share and their share of seats in the Bundestag.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Total Seats in the Bundestag\n\nThe total number of seats in the Bundestag for the 2021 federal election was **735** (Document 4, \"Total seats\" row). This number is used to calculate the percentage share of seats for each party.\n\n### 2. Parties that Won Seats\n\nThere were 8 parties that won at least one seat. For each, the difference between their popular vote share and seat share was calculated:\n\n*   **Social Democratic Party (SPD)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 25.71%\n    *   Seats: 206 (28.03% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |28.03% - 25.71%| = **2.32 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **Christian Democratic Union (CDU)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 18.95%\n    *   Seats: 152 (20.68% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |20.68% - 18.95%| = **1.73 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **Alliance 90/The Greens (GR√úNE)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 14.72%\n    *   Seats: 118 (16.05% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |16.05% - 14.72%| = **1.33 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **Free Democratic Party (FDP)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 11.43%\n    *   Seats: 91 (12.38% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |12.38% - 11.43%| = **0.95 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **Alternative for Germany (AfD)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 10.39%\n    *   Seats: 83 (11.29% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |11.29% - 10.39%| = **0.90 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **Christian Social Union (CSU)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 5.19%\n    *   Seats: 45 (6.12% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |6.12% - 5.19%| = **0.93 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **The Left (DIE LINKE)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 4.87%\n    *   Seats: 39 (5.31% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |5.31% - 4.87%| = **0.44 points** (less than 2.5)\n\n*   **South Schleswig Voters' Association (SSW)**:\n    *   Popular Vote Share: 0.12%\n    *   Seats: 1 (0.14% of 735)\n    *   Difference: |0.14% - 0.12%| = **0.02 points** (less than 2.5)\n\nAll 8 parties that won seats had a difference of less than 2.5 points.\n\n### 3. Parties that Won Zero Seats\n\nFor any party that won zero seats, their share of seats is 0%. The difference is therefore equal to their popular vote share. According to the results table in Document 4:\n\n*   The **Free Voters (FREIE W√ÑHLER)** had the highest popular vote share among parties with zero seats, at **2.43%**.\n*   The difference for the Free Voters is |2.43% - 0%| = **2.43 points**, which is less than 2.5.\n*   All other parties that won zero seats had a popular vote share lower than 2.43%. Therefore, the difference for all of them is also less than 2.5 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince all parties that won seats and all parties that did not win seats meet the criterion, every competing party had less than a 2.5 point difference. Document 8 states, \"A total of 47 parties and lists were approved to run in the 2021 federal election.\" The results table in Document 4 lists these 47 distinct parties.\n\nTherefore, **47** parties met the condition.",

      ],
      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, the percentage of people in the Balkans that do not speak a Slavic language is approximately **57.1%**.\n\nThis calculation is based on the populations and language data for the following Balkan countries and regions mentioned in the documents: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and East Thrace (European Turkey). The calculation primarily uses data on native or mother tongue speakers from national censuses.\n\n### **Detailed Breakdown**\n\n**1. Total Population of the Balkans**\n\nThe total population of the Balkan countries covered in the documents is calculated as follows:\n*   **Albania:** 2,402,113 (2023 census, Doc 41)\n*   **Bosnia and Herzegovina:** 3,434,000 (2022 estimate, Doc 1)\n*   **Bulgaria:** 6,445,481 (2023 estimate, Doc 42)\n*   **Croatia:** 3,861,967 (2023 estimate, Doc 6)\n*   **Greece:** 10,400,720 (2024 estimate, Doc 43)\n*   **Kosovo:** 1,585,566 (2024 census, Doc 44)\n*   **Montenegro:** 623,633 (2023 census, Doc 45)\n*   **North Macedonia:** 1,836,713 (2021 census, Doc 46)\n*   **Serbia:** 6,605,168 (2024 estimate, excluding Kosovo, Doc 48)\n*   **East Thrace (European Turkey):** 12,030,038 (estimated as 15% of Turkey's population of 80,200,256, Docs 47 & 36)\n*   **Total Population:** **49,225,399**\n\n**2. Population of Non-Slavic Language Speakers**\n\nThe number of people who do not speak a Slavic language as their native tongue is calculated for each country:\n\n*   **Albania:** The official and primary language is Albanian, which is not a Slavic language (Doc 8, 40). The population is considered overwhelmingly non-Slavic speaking.\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* **2,402,113**\n*   **Greece:** The official language is Greek, spoken by about 99.5% of the population (Doc 49). Greek is not a Slavic language.\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* **10,400,720**\n*   **Kosovo:** 94.5% of the population are native Albanian speakers, 1.1% Turkish, and 0.3% Romani (Doc 4). These are all non-Slavic languages, totaling 95.9%.\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* 95.9% of 1,585,566 = **1,520,558**\n*   **East Thrace (Turkey):** The official language is Turkish, which is not Slavic (Doc 22). The population is predominantly Turkish-speaking.\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* **12,030,038**\n*   **Bulgaria:** According to the 2011 census, 85.2% of respondents speak the Slavic language Bulgarian (Doc 23). The main non-Slavic languages are Turkish (9.12%) and Romani (4.23%). The total percentage of non-Slavic speakers is approximately 13.8%.\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* 13.8% of 6,445,481 = **889,476**\n*   **North Macedonia:** Based on census data, major non-Slavic languages include Albanian (507,989 speakers), Turkish (71,757), Romani (38,528), and Aromanian (6,884) out of a total population of 2,022,547 (Doc 26, 39). This constitutes about 30.9% of the population.\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* 30.9% of 1,836,713 = **567,713**\n*   **Serbia:** Based on the 2022 ethnic breakdown (excluding Kosovo), notable non-Slavic groups include Hungarians (2.6%) and Roma (1.2%) (Doc 48).\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* 3.8% of 6,605,168 = **250,996**\n*   **Montenegro:** Albanian is the most significant non-Slavic language, spoken by 5.25% of the population (Doc 31).\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* 5.25% of 623,633 = **32,741**\n*   **Croatia:** The main non-Slavic minority languages with available data are Hungarian (16,500 speakers, Doc 35) and German (2,986 speakers, Doc 38).\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* 16,500 + 2,986 = **19,486**\n*   **Bosnia and Herzegovina:** The official languages are Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian, all of which are Slavic languages (Doc 1). While there are recognized non-Slavic minority languages like Ladino (spoken by just 2 people), the documents do not provide data for any significant non-Slavic speaking population (Doc 34).\n    *   *Non-Slavic Speakers:* **~0** (negligible based on available data)\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Total Non-Slavic Speakers:** 2,402,113 + 10,400,720 + 1,520,558 + 12,030,038 + 889,476 + 567,713 + 250,996 + 32,741 + 19,486 + 0 = **28,113,841**\n*   **Percentage of Non-Slavic Speakers:** (28,113,841 / 49,225,399) * 100 ‚âà **57.1%**",

Nearly half of Filipino Americans speak English exclusively (Document 3).\n*   **Major Religions**: The provided documents do not contain information on the major religions practiced by Filipino Americans.\n\n### **Indian Americans**\n*   **Languages**: American English, Indian English, Hindi-Urdu, Telugu, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Punjabi, and other Indian languages (Document 12).\n*   **Major Religions**: The most common religion is Hinduism (48%), followed by those with no religion (18%), Christianity (15%), Islam (8%), and Sikhism (8%) (Documents 11, 12).\n\n### **Vietnamese Americans**\n*   **Languages**: Vietnamese and English (Document 10).\n*   **Major Religions**: The main religions are Buddhism (37%) and Christianity (36%), with a significant portion being unaffiliated (23%).

The response lists multiple languages for each group, sometimes including both heritage and English, while the correct_answer often lists only one language per group. For Filipino Americans, the response omits religion, while the correct_answer specifies Christianity. For Vietnamese Americans, the percentages for Buddhism and Christianity differ from the correct_answer (37% vs. 43% for Buddhism), and the language pairing is not as precise. For Indian Americans, the response lists multiple languages and religions with percentages, but the correct_answer pairs Hindi with each religion and \"No religion\" as separate entries. The response also sometimes combines multiple languages or religions in a single entry, while the correct_answer separates them. Therefore, there are meaningful differences and ambiguities.\n\ncorrect: no\n\noverlapping answers: Chinese Americans - 52% unaffiliated ### Korean Americans - English - 61% Protestantism ### Korean Americans - English - 23% Unaffiliated ### Korean Americans - English - 10% Roman Catholicism ### Korean Americans - English - 6% Buddhism ### Korean Americans - Korean - 61% Protestantism ### Korean Americans - Korean -",

However, a 1974 analysis by Gershom Scholem showed that this etymology was based on a \"fabulated\" and unattested Aramaic term and is no longer endorsed (Document 2).\n\n2.  **Yao** (or Iao)\n    *   **Origin**: The name is thought to originate either from \"Yahweh\" or from the \"magic cry *iao* in the Mystery cults\" (Document 1).\n\n3.  **Sabaoth**\n    *   **Origin**: The name is said to be derived from \"Sabbath,\" corresponding to the 7th Heaven of rest that he rules. An alternative origin is the Hebrew Bible term *Tzevaot*, meaning \"Armies,\" which was thought to be a proper name (Document 1).\n\n4.  **Adonaios**\n    *   **Origin**: The name comes from the Hebrew term for \"the Lord,\" which is used for God.

Specifically, Rome's population is significantly lower than the correct value (2,761,632 vs. 4,342,212), Palermo's population is lower (630,828 vs. 676,118), and Naples' population is slightly higher (914,758 vs. 909,048). Additionally, Palermo's population density is missing, while the correct value is 3,900/km¬≤. These differences are not within the allowed margin of error, especially for Rome and Palermo. Therefore, the extracted_final_answer does not match the [correct_answer].\n\ncorrect: no\n\noverlapping answers: Milan - 1,371,498 - 7,800/km¬≤###Naples - 914,758 - 7,800/km¬≤###Turin - 848,885 - 6,500/km¬≤###Genoa - 560,688 - 2,400/km¬≤###Bologna - 392,203 - 2,800/km¬≤###Florence - 367,150 - 3,600/km¬≤",

      "llm_response": "Based on the documents provided, the annual average percentage of American Nobel Prize winners has increased dramatically over the past century. Initially a very small fraction, the proportion of American laureates grew substantially after the 1930s and has remained over 50% for most of the last 50 years.\n\nThe trend can be broken down by decades since the Nobel Prize's inception in 1901:\n\n| Period | Total Individual Laureates* | American Laureates* | Percentage of American Laureates |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1901-1910** | 56 | 1 | 1.8% |\n| **1911-1920** | 39 | 2 | 5.1% |\n| **1921-1930** | 46 | 3 | 6.5% |\n| **1931-1939** | 46 | 13 | 28.3% |\n| **1943-1950** | 48 | 18 | 37.5% |\n| **1951-1960** | 63 | 29 | 46.0% |\n| **1961-1970** | 69 | 31 | 44.9% |\n| **1971-1980** | 94 | 50 | 53.2% |\n| **1981-1990** | 83 | 47 | 56.6% |\n| **1991-2000** | 91 | 51 | 56.0% |\n| **2001-2010** | 106 | 59 | 55.7% |\n| **2011-2020** | 110 | 55 | 50.0% |\n| **2021-2024** | 45 | 25 | 55.6% |\n\n*\\*Note: The counts are based on individual laureates identified as American in the provided documents (e.g., Document 20, 25, 60, 122). Prizes awarded to organizations are excluded, and years where prizes were cancelled (e.g., 1940-1942) are not included in the totals.*\n\n**Summary of the Trend:**\n\n*   **Early 20th Century (1901‚Äì1930):** In the first three decades of the Nobel Prize, Americans were infrequent winners. The first American laureate was Theodore Roosevelt, who received the Peace Prize in 1906 (Document 12). Through 1930, the percentage of American winners remained below 7%.\n*   **Mid-Century Rise (1931‚Äì1970):** The 1930s marked a significant turning point, with the percentage of American laureates jumping to over 28%. This sharp increase continued after World War II. For example, in 1946, seven of the eleven individual winners were American, including Percy Williams Bridgman in Physics and James B. Sumner, John Howard Northrop, and Wendell Meredith Stanley in Chemistry (Documents 84, 86, 88, 248). By the 1950s and 1960s, Americans consistently accounted for about 45% of all laureates.\n*   **Late 20th Century Peak (1971‚Äì2000):** American representation reached its peak during this period, consistently exceeding 50% in each decade. The 1980s saw the highest proportion, with nearly 57% of all Nobel laureates being American. This dominance was evident across fields, such as in 1990 when nine Americans won, including Elias James Corey in Chemistry and Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller, and William F. Sharpe in Economic Sciences (Documents 52, 56).\n*   **21st Century (2001‚ÄìPresent):** The trend of high American representation has continued into the 21st century. While the percentage dipped slightly to 50% in the 2010s, it has remained robust. For instance, in 2009, ten of the thirteen laureates were American, including Barack Obama for Peace and Elinor Ostrom in Economic Sciences (Documents 55, 59). In the early 2020s, the proportion has risen again to over 55%.",

There are 49 such countries identified:\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Guinea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.\n\n**2. Determine Sunni Majority Status**\nNext, the provided documents are reviewed to determine the Sunni/Shia/other denomination breakdown for these 49 countries. Information is available for 34 of the 49 countries.\n\n*   **Countries with a Sunni Majority:** The documents explicitly state that 33 of these countries have a Sunni majority. For example, Document 23 states that in Indonesia, \"Sunnis constituting 99% of the Muslim population,\" and Document 14 notes that in Pakistan, 90% of Muslims are Sunni.\n*   **Countries Without a Sunni Majority:** Among the countries for which information is provided, only Lebanon does not have a Sunni majority.

These included individuals of Canaanite (Semitic) origin, such as Yakbim, and some with names related to Nubia, like King Nehesy (\"The Nubian\") (Document 14).\n*   **Fifteenth Dynasty:** This was a foreign dynasty founded by the Hyksos, who came from West Asia. They invaded and conquered Lower Egypt, establishing their capital at Avaris (Document 30, Document 29).\n*   **Twenty-second and Twenty-third Dynasties:** These dynasties were of ancient Libyan origin, consisting of Meshwesh kings (Document 31, Document 22, Document 29).\n*   **Twenty-fifth Dynasty:** This line of pharaohs originated from the Kingdom of Kush, located in what is now northern Sudan and Upper Egypt. These rulers are also referred to as Nubian, and they considered Napata their spiritual homeland (Document 24, Document 29).\n*   **Twenty-seventh and Thirty-first Dynasties:** These two dynasties represent periods of Persian rule. They were satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, founded by Persian kings Cambyses II and Artaxerxes III, respectively (Document 32, Document 33, Document 29). The 31st Dynasty is also mentioned as a \"Persian-ruled\" dynasty in Document 1.\n*   **Argead Dynasty:** This was a Greek dynasty whose origins were traced to Argos in Southern Greece. Its most famous rulers over Egypt were Philip II of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great (Document 34, Document 29).\n*   **Ptolemaic Dynasty:** This was a long-lasting Greek dynasty that ruled from Alexandria (Document 29). The founder was a Greek-speaking ruler for whom the Egyptian priest Manetho likely wrote his history of dynasties (Document 1).",

He was the \"King of the Gods\" and the god of the \"sky, lightning, thunder, law, and order\" (Document 9).\n\n*   **Norse:** The head of the pantheon was **Odin**, who is described as the \"ruler of Asgard, and leader of the Aesir\" (Document 2).

For the Greek pantheon, Zeus's domains are mostly correct but miss \"the sky\" as a clear domain (though it is mentioned in the description). For the Norse pantheon, Odin's domains are correctly listed. For the Mayan pantheon, the response gives Itzamna as the head, not Hunab Ku, and does not specify any domains. For the Japanese pantheon, the response lists both Ame-no-Minakanushi and Amaterasu, but only Amaterasu matches the correct_answer, and her domain (sun) is included.

The documents do not contain a complete record of playoff wins for either coach.\n\nHere is a summary of the information available for each coach:\n\n**Steve Kerr:**\nSteve Kerr became the head coach of the Golden State Warriors in the 2014-15 season (Document 1). The documents provide the following playoff results:\n*   **2015-16:** Lost in the NBA Finals 4-3 to the Cavaliers, which equates to 15 playoff wins that season (Document 5).\n*   **2016-17:** Won the NBA championship, defeating the Cavaliers 4-1 in the Finals. A championship run requires 16 wins (Document 6).\n*   **2017-18:** Reached and won the NBA Finals, requiring 16 playoff wins (Document 8).\n*   **2018-19:** Lost in the NBA Finals 4-2 to the Raptors, which equates to 14 playoff wins that season (Document 9).\n*   **2019-20:** Did not qualify for the playoffs (Document 10).\n*   **2021-22:** Won the NBA championship, defeating the Celtics 4-2 in the Finals, which is 16 playoff wins (Document 11, 12).\n\nThe documents do not specify the win total for the 2014-15 championship season, but a championship run typically results in 16 wins. Based on the information available, a partial count for Steve Kerr can be calculated, but it is not a complete career total.\n\n**Gregg Popovich:**\nGregg Popovich became the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1996-97 season (Document 2). The documents provide the following information:\n*   He has won **five NBA championships** as head coach: 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014 (Document 3). These championship seasons alone account for a minimum of 79 playoff wins (15 in the lockout-shortened 1999 season, and 16 for each of the other four).\n*   Partial results from other playoff years include:\n    *   **1997-98:** 1 win (Document 15).\n    *   **1999-00:** 1 win (Document 16).\n    *   **2001-02:** Lost in the Conference Semifinals (Document 18).\n    *   **2008-09:** 1 win (Document 20).\n    *   **2014-15:** 3 wins (Document 23).\n*   The Spurs did not qualify for the playoffs in the following seasons: 1996-97, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24 (Documents 14, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31).\n*   The documents confirm the Spurs made the playoffs in numerous other seasons (e.g., 2000-01, 2003-04, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19) but do not provide the number of wins for those campaigns (Documents 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe documents provide an incomplete record for both coaches, especially for Gregg Popovich, whose career is significantly longer and has many playoff appearances for which win totals are not listed.

Document 9 specifies, \"The first uprising for independence was led by parish priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who issued the Cry of Dolores on 16 September 1810.\"\n\n*   **Apache‚ÄìMexico Wars (phase beginning in 1831):** After Mexico gained independence, a period of peace with the Apache ended. The Mexican government's actions directly led to renewed war. Document 10 states that \"in 1831, the Mexican government cut off food rations to Apaches\" and subsequently, \"The military commander of Chihuahua declared war on the Apache on October 16, 1831, and initiated military action against them.\"\n\n*   **Salvadoran-Mexican War:** The outcome of this war, where \"El Salvador is annexed to Mexico,\" indicates that Mexico initiated the conflict to absorb the neighboring country (Document 1).\n\n*   **Occupation of Soconusco:** Similar to the war with El Salvador, the result of this conflict was that \"The Soconusco is annexed to Mexico,\" implying Mexico initiated the action against Guatemala to take the territory (Document 1).\n\n*   **Invasion of Yucat√°n (1842-1843):** The name of the conflict in Document 1 indicates that Mexico was the aggressor, invading the Republic of Yucat√°n, which had declared independence.\n\n*   **Mexicans Invasions of 1842:** The title of this conflict explicitly states that Mexico initiated invasions against the Republic of Texas (Document 1).\n\n*   **Mexican annexation of Clipperton Island (1897):** The result of this conflict was a \"Mexican annexation\" and the establishment of a colony, which led to a dispute with France. This indicates an action initiated by Mexico (Document 1).\n\n*   **Dirty War (1968‚Äì1982):** This was an internal conflict initiated by the Mexican government against its own citizens. Document 5 describes it as a conflict \"between the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)-ruled government... and left-wing student and guerrilla groups,\" during which government forces carried out severe human rights abuses.\n\n*   **Mexican Drug War (2006‚Äìpresent):** This is an ongoing internal conflict that the Mexican government initiated against various drug cartels operating within the country (Document 1).",

Document 2 establishes the historical context of Israeli politics alternating between \"rule by the right-wing Likud\" and \"rule by the center-left Labor,\" also mentioning the \"centrist Kadima party.\" Based on the list of Prime Ministers and their parties in Document 6, governments led by PMs from Likud (right-wing), Kadima (centrist), Yamina (right-wing), and Yesh Atid (centrist) were identified as non-Left wing.\n2.  **Calculating Duration:** The start and end dates for each identified government were taken from the \"List of cabinets\" in Document 1. The duration for each government was calculated, and these durations were summed up.\n3.  **Current Government:** The 37th government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, is listed as incumbent (Document 1).

Israel uses a pure party-list system, while Germany uses a mixed-member proportional system.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the differences:\n\n*   **Voting System:**\n    *   **Israel:** Employs a \"closed-list method of party-list proportional representation.\" In this system, citizens cast a single vote for their \"preferred party\" and not for any individual candidates (Document 1). All 120 seats in the Knesset are assigned based on the national proportion of votes each party receives.\n    *   **Germany:** Uses a \"mixed member proportional system (MMP).\" Voters cast two votes: one for a specific constituency representative and a second for a party (Document 2).\n\n*   **Candidate Election:**\n    *   **Israel:** No members are directly elected by constituencies. All representatives are selected from the lists submitted by the political parties.\n    *   **Germany:** The system combines direct and proportional election. Half of the members (299) are directly elected in \"single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting.\" The other half are allocated from \"party lists\" to ensure the final composition of the Bundestag is proportional to the second (party) votes cast by the electorate (Document 2).\n\n*   **Parliamentary Composition:**\n    *   **Israel:** The Knesset has a fixed number of 120 seats, which are distributed proportionally among parties that pass the 3.25% electoral threshold (Document 1).\n    *   **Germany:** The Bundestag has a nominal number of 598 members, but this can increase due to \"overhang seats.\" These extra seats are created when a party wins more single-member constituencies directly than it would be entitled to under its proportional party vote share (Document 2).",

      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, **4.17%** of Academy Award winning directors for Best Director attended the Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nThis percentage is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **Total Number of Unique Winning Directors:**\n    The provided documents list the winners for the Best Director award for the 1930s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Other documents also mention the winners for 2020, 2021, and 2022. Counting each unique director who won the award across all these documents gives a total of **72** individual winners.\n\n2.  **Number of Winning Directors Who Attended Tisch:**\n    Out of the 72 unique winners identified in the documents, three are explicitly mentioned as having attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts as students:\n    *   **Ang Lee**: Won in 2005 and 2012. Document 11 states that he \"enrolled at the Tisch School of the Arts of New York University, where he received his MFA in film production.\"\n    *   **Martin Scorsese**: Won in 2006. Document 13 mentions his time as a student, stating, \"While attending the Tisch School of the Arts, Scorsese made the short films...\"\n    *   **Chlo√© Zhao**: Won in 2020 (Document 16). Document 10 details her education, noting that she \"joined the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television Graduate Film Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.\"\n\n    Other directors mentioned in connection with NYU are not counted because the documents do not specify they attended the *Tisch School of the Arts* specifically. For instance, John G. Avildsen was educated at \"New York University\" (Document 15), and Woody Allen \"attended New York University\" in 1953 before Tisch was established (Document 12). Oliver Stone was named an artistic director at Tisch, not a student (Document 14).\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   (Number of winners who went to Tisch / Total number of unique winners) * 100\n    *   (3 / 72) * 100 = **4.17%**",

      "llm_response": "Based on the documents provided, here is how each English Monarchic dynasty since William the Conqueror came to rule:\n\n*   **House of Normandy (1066‚Äì1135)**: The documents list this house as beginning its rule in 1066, the year William the Conqueror took the throne, succeeding the short-lived House of Godwin (Document 1).\n\n*   **House of Blois (1135‚Äì1154)**: Following the death of King Henry I (of Normandy), his nephew Stephen of Blois \"seized the throne\" in 1135. This was in defiance of Henry I's wish for his daughter, Empress Matilda, to succeed him, and it precipitated the civil war known as The Anarchy (Document 2).\n\n*   **House of Plantagenet (Angevins) (1154‚Äì1399)**: This dynasty came to power through a negotiated settlement that ended The Anarchy. The Treaty of Wallingford in 1153 stipulated that Stephen of Blois would remain king for the rest of his life, but he had to recognize Empress Matilda's son, Henry Plantagenet, as his designated heir (Document 3).\n\n*   **House of Capet (1216‚Äì1217)**: This house made a disputed claim to the throne. Louis VIII of France was invited by English barons to invade and claim the crown through his wife, a granddaughter of Henry II of England. Although he was \"briefly acclaimed\" as king, he was never crowned. He was ultimately forced to sign the Treaty of Lambeth, which \"legally decreed that he had never been king of England\" (Document 9).\n\n*   **House of Lancaster (1399‚Äì1461, 1470‚Äì1471)**: A cadet branch of the House of Plantagenet, the Lancastrians came to power when Henry, the son of John of Gaunt, \"usurped the throne in 1399.\" This act led to dynastic struggles known as the Wars of the Roses (Document 4).\n\n*   **House of York (1461‚Äì1470, 1471‚Äì1485)**: During the Wars of the Roses, the Yorkists, another branch of the Plantagenet dynasty, took the throne. After a series of victories over the Lancastrians, Edward, son of Richard, Duke of York, was \"declared king in London in 1461\" and solidified his claim by winning the decisive Battle of Towton (Document 7).\n\n*   **House of Tudor (1485‚Äì1603)**: The Tudor dynasty was established through military victory. At the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Henry Tudor, leading an alliance of Lancastrians, defeated and killed Richard III, the last Yorkist king. Henry Tudor became the first Tudor monarch through this victory and later married a Yorkist princess to unify the houses (Document 5).\n\n*   **House of Stuart (1603‚Äì1714)**: The Stuarts came to power through inheritance. When the last Tudor monarch, Elizabeth I, died childless in 1603, the throne passed to her cousin, James VI of Scotland. James was the \"great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England,\" giving him a strong claim (Document 8).\n\n*   **House of Hanover (1714‚Äì1901)**: The Hanoverian dynasty began in 1714 when George I, the prince-elector of Hanover, \"assumed the throne of Great Britain and Ireland.\" His claim was based on his descent from King James I of the House of Stuart (Document 6).\n\n*   **House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1901‚Äì1917)**: This dynasty began through direct inheritance but involved a change in the dynastic name. When Queen Victoria of the House of Hanover died in 1901, her eldest son, Edward VII, inherited the throne. Because his father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the royal house took on his name (Documents 6, 10).\n\n*   **House of Windsor (1917‚Äìpresent)**: The House of Windsor was established not by a change in the ruling family but by a name change. In 1917, King George V, a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, issued a Royal Proclamation that the name of the royal house and family would henceforth be known as Windsor (Documents 10, 11).",

From Merovingian to Carolingian**\nThe Carolingian family rose to power while officially serving as mayors of the palace under the Merovingian kings. Over time, they became the \"real powers behind the Merovingian kings\" (Document 8). In 751, Pepin the Short, son of the influential mayor Charles Martel, dethroned the Merovingians with the approval of the Papacy and the aristocracy to become King of the Franks, thus establishing the Carolingian dynasty (Documents 8, 10).\n\n**2. Carolingian, Robertian, and Bosonid Period**\nBetween 888 and 987, the French throne alternated between the Carolingians and powerful noble families like the Robertians and Bosonids (Document 3). The Robertians, who were connected to the Carolingians by marriage, first produced a king when Odo was chosen to rule from 888 to 898 (Document 5). This period was marked by political instability and elections rather than strict hereditary succession.\n\n**3. From Carolingian to Capetian**\nThe Capetian dynasty was founded by Hugh Capet, a member of the Robertian family (Document 5). In 987, following the death of the last Carolingian king, Louis V, Hugh Capet \"secured the throne of France by election\" (Document 12). He then ensured the throne would remain in his family by having his son, Robert II, crowned as co-king, establishing a hereditary succession that would last for centuries (Document 12).\n\n**4. From the House of Capet to the House of Valois**\nThe direct line of the House of Capet ended with the death of King Charles IV in 1328, who left no male heir (Documents 2, 3). The throne then passed to the most senior cadet branch of the dynasty. Philip VI, son of Charles of Valois (the younger brother of King Philip IV), ascended the throne, beginning the rule of the House of Valois. This succession was based on the principle of male-only primogeniture through Salic Law (Documents 1, 17).\n\n**5. Transitions Within the House of Valois**\n*   **Valois to Valois-Orl√©ans:** When King Charles VIII died childless in 1498, he was succeeded by his distant cousin, Louis, Duke of Orl√©ans, who became King Louis XII. This marked the transfer of power to the Valois-Orl√©ans branch (Documents 1, 14).\n*   **Valois-Orl√©ans to Valois-Angoul√™me:** Louis XII died without a legitimate son in 1515. The crown passed to his cousin and son-in-law, Francis I, from the Angoul√™me cadet branch, establishing the House of Valois-Angoul√™me (Documents 1, 7).\n\n**6. From the House of Valois to the House of Bourbon**\nThe House of Valois became extinct in the male line with the death of King Henry III in 1589. According to Salic Law, the throne passed to the next most senior branch of the Capetian dynasty, the House of Bourbon. Henry IV, the head of the House of Bourbon, became king (Document 9). This dynastic shift was politically solidified when Margaret of Valois, the last legitimate descendant of her house, named the Bourbon Dauphin Louis as her heir (Document 4).\n\n**7. From the House of Bourbon to the House of Bonaparte**\nThe Bourbon monarchy was overthrown during the French Revolution in 1792 (Document 9). Years later, Napoleon Bonaparte established the First French Empire, and the House of Bonaparte ruled from 1804 to 1814 and again briefly in 1815 (Documents 2, 3). This was a seizure of power, not a dynastic succession.\n\n**8. From Bonaparte to Bourbon Restoration**\nThe Bourbons were restored to the throne in 1814 and again in 1815 after the fall of Napoleon's empire (Documents 3, 9).\n\n**9. From the House of Bourbon to the House of Orl√©ans**\nThe senior line of the Bourbons was overthrown for a final time in the July Revolution of 1830. King Charles X was deposed and replaced by his distant cousin, Louis Philippe I, from the cadet House of Orl√©ans, who was seen as more liberal (Documents 9, 16). His reign, known as the July Monarchy, lasted until 1848 (Document 2).",

      "llm_response": "Based on the documents provided, the motivations of the main antagonists in Shakespeare's plays are as follows:\n\n**Tragedies**\n\n*   **Antony and Cleopatra**: The main antagonist is **Octavius Caesar**. His motivation is political power and consolidating his rule over the Roman Republic. He is displeased with Antony's actions, which challenge his authority and share of power (Docs 20, 53).\n*   **Coriolanus**: The antagonists are the **tribunes and the plebeians**. Their motivation is \"mutual hostility\" with Coriolanus and political opposition to his consulship, which leads to his banishment. Later, his former Volscian allies become his antagonists, killing him after he makes peace with Rome (Doc 24).\n*   **Hamlet**: The main antagonist is **King Claudius**. His motivation is ambition and desire; he \"obtained the throne of Denmark by murdering his brother with poison and then marrying the late king's widow\" (Doc 17).\n*   **Julius Caesar**: The role of antagonist is a matter of perspective.\n    *   From Caesar's perspective, the antagonists are the conspirators, including **Brutus and Cassius**. Their motivation is to prevent Caesar from \"becoming a tyrant\" (Doc 48).\n    *   From the conspirators' perspective, the antagonist is **Mark Antony**, who is motivated by loyalty to Caesar and a desire for revenge, stirring \"up hostility against the conspirators\" (Doc 48).\n*   **King Lear**:\n    *   **Edmund** is the main antagonist. He is motivated by resentment of his illegitimate status and a desire for power, plotting \"to get rid of his brother, then his father, and become Earl in his own right\" (Doc 18).\n    *   **Goneril and Regan**, Lear's daughters, are also antagonists. They are motivated by power; once their father grants them his kingdom, they strip him of his dignity and respect (Doc 45).\n*   **Macbeth**: The antagonist is **Macbeth** himself. His motivation is ambition and the desire to be king, which leads him to tyranny (Doc 28).\n*   **Othello**: The main antagonist is **Iago**. His primary motivation is that he \"hates Othello and devises a plan to destroy him\" (Doc 19).\n*   **Romeo and Juliet**:\n    *   **Tybalt** is an antagonist motivated by his family's feud and his hatred for the Montagues (Doc 16).\n    *   **Lord Capulet** acts as an antagonist to his daughter, Juliet. He is motivated by the belief that he knows what is best for her and by a \"misguided attempt to cheer her up\" by forcing her to marry Count Paris. When she refuses, he is driven by fury (Doc 43).\n*   **Titus Andronicus**:\n    *   **Aaron** is a primary antagonist, motivated by pure malice. He engineers murder and rape and frames others for his crimes (Doc 25).\n    *   **Demetrius and Chiron** are motivated by lust when they rape Lavinia (Doc 25).\n\n**Comedies**\n\n*   **A Midsummer Night's Dream**: **Egeus**, Hermia's father, acts as an antagonist. His motivation is to enforce his paternal authority and an \"ancient Athenian law\" that dictates his daughter must marry the suitor he has chosen or face death (Doc 35).\n*   **The Merchant of Venice**: The antagonist is **Shylock**. He is motivated by revenge and business rivalry. He seeks a pound of Antonio's flesh due to the \"abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand,\" including \"outspoken antisemitism\" and business practices that forced Shylock to lower his rates (Doc 55).\n*   **Much Ado About Nothing**: The villain is **Don John**. His motivation is to \"sow chaos\" by making false accusations to ruin the marriage of Hero and Claudio (Docs 7, 31).\n*   **Twelfth Night**: **Malvolio** acts as an antagonist to the play's revellers. He is a puritan who is motivated by a desire for order and his disdain for \"all manner of fun and games\" (Doc 49).\n\n**Histories**\n\n*   **Edward III**: **King Edward III** acts as an antagonist in the first part of the play. He is motivated by lust when he \"immediately falls for the Countess [of Salisbury], and proceeds to woo her for himself\" (Doc 15).\n*   **Henry IV (Parts 1 & 2)**: The antagonists are the **rebel lords**, including **Hotspur, the Earls of Worcester and Northumberland, and the Archbishop of York**. Their motivation is political rebellion against King Henry IV (Docs 57, 59).\n*   **Henry V**: The antagonist is the **French Dauphin**. His motivation is to resist and mock King Henry's claim to the French throne, which he demonstrates by sending an insulting gift of tennis balls meant to symbolize Henry's \"perceived youth and frivolity\" (Doc 13).\n*   **Henry VI, Part 1**: The antagonist is the **Dauphin Charles** of France, who is motivated to lead a rebellion to reclaim France from English control (Doc 14).\n*   **Henry VI, Part 2**: The **Duke of York** is a central antagonist. His motivation is ambition and the desire for power, as the play focuses on his \"rise\" and the \"inevitability of armed conflict\" (Doc 52).\n*   **Henry VI, Part 3**: According to the provided documents, this play \"has no antagonist, and both sides in the conflict are depicted as capable of atrocities in their pursuit of victory\" (Doc 23).\n*   **Henry VIII**: The villain is **Cardinal Wolsey**. He is motivated by a desire for personal gain through the \"abuse of the tax system for his own purposes\" (Docs 21, 33).\n*   **King John**: **King John** can be seen as the antagonist. His motivation is to retain the English throne against the claim of his nephew, Arthur (Docs 11, 32).\n*   **Richard II**:\n    *   **Bolingbroke** (the future Henry IV) is the antagonist to Richard. His motivation is initially to reclaim his lands, which then grows into an ambition for the throne itself (Doc 12).\n    *   **Sir Piers Exton** murders the imprisoned Richard, motivated by a desire \"to gain favour\" with the new king (Doc 12).\n\n**Romances/Problem Plays**\n\n*   **Cymbeline**: The antagonist is **Iachimo**. He is motivated by pride and the desire to win a wager he made with Posthumus that he could seduce his wife, Imogen (Doc 29).\n*   **Measure for Measure**: **Angelo** is identified as the \"play's main antagonist\" (Doc 6). The provided documents do not state his motivation.\n*   **Pericles, Prince of Tyre**: The initial antagonist is **King Antiochus**. His motivation is to protect the secret of his \"incestuous relationship with his daughter,\" leading him to try to kill Pericles for discovering the truth (Doc 9).\n*   **The Two Noble Kinsmen**: The antagonist is **Creon of Thebes**. He is described as a \"tyrant,\" and his motivation appears to be cruelty, as he \"killed the three kings and refuses to allow them proper burial\" (Doc 10).\n*   **The Winter's Tale**: The antagonist for the first part of the play is **King Leontes**. He is motivated by a sudden and intense jealousy, suspecting that his pregnant wife, Hermione, has been having an affair with his friend Polixenes (Docs 8, 39).\n*   **Timon of Athens**: The antagonists are Timon's **\"parasitic companions.\"** Their motivation is greed and opportunism; they accept his lavish gifts but reject him once his wealth is gone (Docs 26, 54).",

(The [response] provides a long, itemized list for each emperor, including cause of death and reign length.)\n\nfinal answer length: 192\n\nreasoning: The extracted_final_answer is a detailed enumeration of emperors, their reign lengths, and causes of death. Comparing this to the [correct_answer], there are numerous inconsistencies and ambiguities. For example, the [response] sometimes gives a range or multiple possible causes of death (e.g., \"died of illness or was possibly murdered\"), whereas the [correct_answer] specifies a single cause (e.g., \"poison administered by his wife\"). Some reign lengths differ slightly, and some causes of death are less precise or differ in detail (e.g., \"died of natural causes\" vs. \"succumbing to a sudden illness\" or \"cancer\"). There are also cases where the [response] gives more than one possible fate, or is vague where the [correct_answer] is specific. Additionally, the [response] includes emperors and details not present in the [correct_answer], and vice versa. Therefore, the answers do not match exactly, and there are meaningful differences in precision, specificity, and sometimes accuracy.\n\ncorrect: no\n\noverlapping answers: Basil I - a fever contracted after a serious hunting accident when his belt was caught in the antlers of a deer, and he was allegedly dragged 16 miles through the wood - 18 ### Titus - fever - 2 ### Artabasdos - Artabasdos and his sons were publicly blinded and relegated to the monastery of Chora on the outskirts of Constantinople. - 1 (or 2) years and 5 months ### Romanos III Argyros - poison administered by his wife - 5 ### Saloninus - Postumus killed Saloninus - 0 ### Constantine III Heraclius - tuberculosis - 0 ### Romulus Augustulus - Romulus was likely dead before the mid-530s, as accounts of the eastern Roman invasion of Italy at that time do not mention him. - 0 ### Valens - on 9 August 378, Valens and most of his army were killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople - 14 ### Caligula - stabbed - 3 ### Constantine II - killed by Constans",

A robe, tunic, or kirtle was usually worn over the shirt or doublet, over this, a man might also wear an over-kirtle, cloak, or a hood. the chaperon made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings."

Trousers were tailored either loose or tight (or not worn at all if the weather was warm). Leggings were strips of cloth wound round the leg, held in place by long laces. A cloak or mantle, fastened by a brooch, completed the outfit. For headgear, the cappa or chaperon was a one-piece hood and cape over the shoulders was worn for cold weather, and the Roman straw hat for summer fieldwork.

Tailored cloth leggings called chausses or hose, made as separate garments for each leg, the hose became longer and more fitting and reached above the knees. Over the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt. Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts. Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams. The newly introduced doublet and the quilted and padded jupe or gipon were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic. The sleeveless surcoat or cyclas was introduced as protective covering for armour. Rectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic, fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front. As headgear, the chaperon in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn, as well as the fitted linen coif tied under the chin. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer."

One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head, where the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a garnache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardecorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A mantle was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, shoes, and headdress. Men wore long braies or leggings with legs of varying length. Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the beret, the coif (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat, and a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders.

Over the shirt was worn a doublet, very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, with the sleeves being full and even puffy. Men wore short braies or breeches, a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt. Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored. As doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the codpiece. The Houppelande, or cioppa, was the overgarment of the wealthy, it was a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ-pipe pleats and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor. A sideless tunic or tabard, called a giornea or journade was popular. For headgear, the hood remained popular, although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into a chaperon. Hats began to compete with the chaperon. Hats of vaious styles: tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all, hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif, or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front.

      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, the changes in European men's formal garb from the High Middle Ages (AD 1000-1300) to the Renaissance (15th and 16th centuries) were significant, particularly in the style and visibility of undergarments and the tailoring of primary garments.\n\nHere are the key changes:\n\n*   **The Shirt's Role and Appearance:**\n    *   **High Middle Ages:** The shirt was a simple linen undergarment, like an inner tunic, worn next to the skin beneath a main tunic or cote (Documents 3, 4). It was not intended to be a visible part of the formal outfit.\n    *   **Renaissance (15th Century):** The shirt evolved into a prominent and decorative fashion element. It became fuller in the body with wide, low necklines. A key new style was \"slashing,\" where the sleeves of the outer doublet were cut to allow the full sleeves of the shirt to be pulled through, creating decorative puffs. As the shirt became more visible, it was often adorned with embroidery or braid for wealthier men (Document 5).\n\n*   **Primary Body Garments:**\n    *   **High Middle Ages:** Men wore a long primary garment called a tunic, cote, or cotte over their shirt (Document 4). This was the central piece of the outfit.\n    *   **Renaissance (15th Century):** The primary garment shifted to the doublet, which was worn over the newly fashionable shirt (Document 5). The documents do not describe the doublet in detail but note its sleeves were slashed to reveal the shirt, indicating a more tailored and complex garment than the earlier tunic.\n\n*   **Outer Layers:**\n    *   **High Middle Ages:** It was common to wear various types of surcoats over the tunic, such as the cyclas, the cap-sleeved garnache, or the long-sleeved gardecorps. For formal occasions, a mantle was also worn as a wrap (Document 4).\n    *   **Renaissance (15th Century):** The documents emphasize the combination of the shirt, doublet, and hose, suggesting a move away from the long, layered surcoats of the previous era toward a more form-fitting silhouette where the doublet was the primary outer garment (Document 5).\n\n*   **Legwear:**\n    *   **High Middle Ages:** Men wore tailored cloth leggings called hose or chausses, which were separate garments for each leg (Document 3, 4).\n    *   **Renaissance (15th Century):** Hose continued to be a staple of men's attire, worn with the doublet (Document 5). The documents do not specify a change in the construction of hose, but they remained a key component of the ensemble.\n\nIn summary, the transition from the High Middle Ages to the Renaissance saw men's formal wear evolve from a layered look of long tunics and surcoats to a more tailored silhouette dominated by the doublet. The most significant change was the elevation of the shirt from a hidden undergarment to a visible, decorated, and integral part of the overall fashion statement.",

      "question": "On average, has the economy in Scandinavia gotten better in the last ten years?",

        true
      ],
      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, the economy in Scandinavia has, on average, gotten better in the last ten years, demonstrated by growth in GDP, lower unemployment in some cases, and consistently high rankings in human development.\n\nHere is a breakdown by country:\n\n### Denmark\nThe data for Denmark in Document 1 provides a clear picture of economic improvement over the last decade (comparing 2013 to 2023):\n*   **GDP Growth:** The nominal GDP grew from $343.6 billion in 2013 to $420.8 billion in 2023. More significantly, the GDP per capita (PPP), which measures individual prosperity, increased substantially from $46,829 to $74,958.\n*   **Unemployment:** The unemployment rate fell from 7.0% in 2013 to 5.0% in 2023.\n*   **Government Debt:** The government debt as a percentage of GDP decreased from 44.0% in 2013 to 30.1% in 2023, indicating improved fiscal health.\n\n### Sweden\nData for Sweden also points to economic growth over the past decade:\n*   **GDP Growth:** According to Document 2, Sweden's nominal GDP in 2014 was $577.7 billion. The 2024 estimate in Document 4 places its nominal GDP at $609.0 billion, showing an increase.\n*   **Economic Strength:** Document 4 highlights Sweden's very high Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.952 (5th globally) as of 2022 and a low Gini coefficient of 27.6, indicating low inequality. Its estimated 2024 GDP per capita (PPP) is $71,730.\n\n### Norway\nWhile Norway's nominal GDP has been more volatile, its economy remains one of the world's strongest:\n*   **GDP Levels:** Document 2 shows Norway's nominal GDP was $501.7 billion in 2014. After a dip in subsequent years (e.g., $408.7 billion in 2019), the 2024 estimate in Document 3 shows a recovery to $503.7 billion.\n*   **Economic Strength:** Document 3 reports that Norway has a very high HDI of 0.966 (2nd globally) as of 2022. The 2024 estimates for GDP per capita are exceptionally high, at $103,446 (PPP) and $90,433 (nominal), ranking 5th in the world for both metrics.\n\nIn summary, across Scandinavia, key economic indicators such as GDP and GDP per capita have generally increased over the last ten years. While some metrics like nominal GDP in Norway show volatility, the overall picture, supported by falling unemployment in Denmark and consistently top-tier human development and per capita income rankings for all three nations, indicates that their economies have improved and remain robust.",

      "llm_response": "Based on the provided documents, the following historic empires ruled over Anatolia from the classical period until the formation of modern-day Turkey:\n\n*   **Achaemenid Empire (546 BC‚Äì330 BC):** Following its conquest of Lydia in 546 BC, which covered \"all of western Anatolia,\" the Achaemenid Empire ruled the region (Documents 2, 8). Its control over the \"Anatolian lands\" ended when it was vanquished by Alexander the Great, with the empire falling by 330 BC (Document 3).\n\n*   **Macedonian Empire (333 BC‚Äì323 BC):** Alexander the Great invaded Asia Minor in 335 BC and had \"effectively vanquished the Persians in the Anatolian lands\" by 333 BC. His empire controlled the region until his death in 323 BC (Document 3).\n\n*   **Seleucid Empire (Post-323 BC):** Following the death of Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire was a major Hellenistic state that emerged from his conquests. The provided documents do not specify the exact years of its rule over Anatolia but identify it as a successor state to Alexander's empire in the region (Document 4).\n\n*   **Roman Empire (c. 133 BC‚Äì395 AD):** Rome began its control of Anatolia when the former Lydian territory became the Roman province of Asia in 133 BC (Document 2). Rome's influence expanded, and after the Mithridatic Wars (which began in 88 BCE), further annexations \"brought all of Anatolia under Roman control\" (Document 9). This rule continued until the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD (Document 5).\n\n*   **Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) (395 AD‚Äìc. 1453 AD):** Following the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire, was formed with its capital at Constantinople. It \"ruled most of the territory of what is today Turkey until the Late Middle Ages\" (Document 5). Its control was later challenged and reduced by the Seljuks (Document 6).\n\n*   **Sultanate of Rum (1077‚Äì1308):** After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia. The Sultanate of Rum was established in 1077 and controlled large areas of the peninsula, with control of Anatolia being \"split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm\" (Documents 6, 7). The Sultanate existed as an independent state until 1243, after which it became a vassal state until its dissolution in 1308 (Document 7).\n\n*   **Ottoman Empire (c. 1299‚Äì1922):** Founded around 1299, the Ottoman Empire gradually expanded to control Anatolia, eventually conquering the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1453. The empire ruled until the sultanate was abolished on November 1, 1922, just prior to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 (Document 10).",

      "llm_response": "Based on the documents provided, here are the early symptoms for the most common types of cancer in men and women.\n\nAccording to Document 1, the most common cancers in men are lung, prostate, colorectal, and stomach cancer. For women, the most common are breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical cancer.\n\n### **Early Symptoms of Common Cancers in Men**\n\n*   **Lung Cancer:** Early lung cancer often presents with no symptoms. When symptoms do arise, they are typically nonspecific and can include a new cough, a change in a pre-existing cough's frequency or strength, shortness of breath, or a dull, persistent chest pain (Documents 2, 7).\n*   **Prostate Cancer:** Early-stage prostate cancer \"usually causes no symptoms.\" Issues such as trouble urinating, blood in the urine, or erectile dysfunction tend to appear as the cancer advances (Document 3).\n*   **Colorectal Cancer:** Many individuals with colorectal cancer, around 50%, do not experience any symptoms (Document 11). When symptoms do occur, they can include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss (Document 4). In people over 50, rectal bleeding and anemia are considered high-risk symptoms (Document 9).\n*   **Stomach Cancer:** This cancer is often asymptomatic in its early stages or may only cause nonspecific symptoms (Document 10). Early symptoms can include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, belching, and loss of appetite (Documents 5, 12).\n\n### **Early Symptoms of Common Cancers in Women**\n\n*   **Breast Cancer:** The provided documents identify breast cancer as one of the most common cancers in women but do not contain information describing its early symptoms.\n*   **Colorectal Cancer:** Similar to men, about 50% of people with this cancer report no symptoms (Document 11). Potential symptoms include blood in the stool, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss (Document 4). For those over 50, rectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms (Document 9).\n*   **Lung Cancer:** As with men, early lung cancer frequently has no symptoms. When present, early symptoms are often nonspecific respiratory problems like a new or altered cough, shortness of breath, or persistent, dull chest pain (Documents 2, 7).\n*   **Cervical Cancer:** The earliest stages of cervical cancer may be \"completely free of symptoms\" (Documents 6, 8). Symptoms that may indicate its presence include unusual vaginal bleeding (particularly after sexual intercourse, a pelvic exam, or douching), moderate pain during intercourse, and vaginal discharge (Document 8).",

For lung cancer, the response omits \"coughing up blood\" and does not explicitly mention \"chest pain\" (only \"dull persistent chest pain\"). For prostate cancer, the response omits \"frequent urination and slow or weak urine stream.\" For colorectal cancer, the response omits \"worsening constipation,\" \"decrease in stool caliber,\" \"nausea in someone over 50,\" \"vomiting in someone over 50,\" \"weight loss associated with rectal bleeding,\" and \"changes in a person's bowel habit associated with rectal bleeding.\" For stomach cancer, the response matches most symptoms. For breast cancer, the response says no information is provided, which is incorrect since the correct answer is \"a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue.\" For cervical cancer, the response omits \"contact bleeding,\" \"bleeding after sexual intercourse,\" \"vaginal mass,\" and \"vaginal bleeding\" (though it does mention \"unusual vaginal bleeding\" and \"bleeding after intercourse\" in a less precise way). The response also adds nonspecific symptoms like \"fatigue\" and \"weight loss\" for colorectal cancer,",

The main prevention methods for each are as follows:\n\n**1. Breast Cancer**\n*   The provided documents do not contain information on prevention methods for breast cancer.\n\n**2. Colorectal Cancer**\nPrevention methods for colorectal cancer involve both screening and lifestyle changes.\n*   **Screening:** Screening is effective for early detection and prevention, as over 80% of colorectal cancers come from adenomatous polyps. Detected polyps can be removed through colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy to prevent them from becoming cancerous. This has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60% (Document 1).\n*   **Lifestyle:** About half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors (Document 6). Prevention methods include:\n    *   Engaging in physical activity and avoiding a lack of exercise (Documents 4, 6).\n    *   Maintaining a normal body weight to avoid obesity (Document 4).\n    *   Consuming a diet high in fiber (Document 6).\n    *   Quitting smoking (Documents 4, 6).\n    *   Limiting alcohol consumption (Documents 4, 6).\n\n**3. Lung Cancer**\nSince most lung cancer cases are caused by tobacco smoking, the primary prevention methods are:\n*   **Quitting Smoking:** This reduces the chance of developing lung cancer (Document 5).\n*   **Avoiding Hazardous Substances:** Prevention efforts also encourage avoiding hazardous chemicals like asbestos and radon gas (Document 5).\n\n**4. Cervical Cancer**\nThe main prevention method for cervical cancer is screening:\n*   **Screening:** Checking for cervical pre-cancer with the Papanicolaou test (Pap test) can reduce cervical cancer incidence by up to 80%. It is recommended to have a Pap test screening every three to five years with appropriate follow-up (Document 3).",

The Gwen Stacy clone then disappears to start a new life (Documents 10, 43).\n\n*   **\"Spider-Verse\"**: This 2014 event featured nearly every version of Spider-Man.

Gwen Stacy is featured not as a living character, but as a memory; J. Jonah Jameson mentioning her death to Norman Osborn is the event that causes Osborn to remember Spider-Man's true identity (Document 3).\n\n*   **\"Dying Wish\"**: Doctor Octopus, having swapped bodies with Peter Parker, romantically reunites with Mary Jane Watson (Document 62). Later in the arc, the real Peter Parker, dying in Doctor Octopus's body, experiences a vision of the afterlife where he meets deceased loved ones, including Gwen Stacy (Document 68).\n\n*   **\"Spider-Geddon\"**: This event features Spider-Gwen, an alternate version of Gwen Stacy from another universe (Document 4).

It is characterized by the emergence of a new leading party and a more diverse coalition.\n*   **Decline of the PCF:** The French Communist Party's representation has drastically decreased from 73 seats to **9 seats** (Document 11).\n*   **Rise of La France Insoumise (LFI):** A new party, **La France Insoumise (LFI)**, founded in 2016, has become the dominant force on the radical left, holding **75 seats** (Documents 4, 17). While the \"far-left\" label for LFI is disputed by political scientists, it is described as a \"left-wing\" party with ideologies including democratic socialism and left-wing populism, and it leads the main left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (Documents 4, 17).\n*   **Presence of Other Far-Left Parties:** Several other smaller parties with far-left ideologies have also gained representation, including:\n    *   **New Anticapitalist Party (NPA):** 1 seat (Document 11).\n    *   **Independent Workers' Party (POI):** 1 seat, with a Marxist ideology (Document 11).\n    *   **Regional Parties:** The **Decolonization and Social Emancipation Movement (MDES)** from French Guiana (1 seat) and **Euskal Herria Bai (EH Bai)** from the Basque Country (1 seat) are also described as far-left or left-wing to far-left (Document 12).\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\nOver the last fifty years, the representation of the extreme left in the French assembly has changed in the following ways:\n1.  **Shift in Dominance:** The dominant political force has shifted from the French Communist Party (PCF) to La France Insoumise (LFI).\n2.  **Composition:** The extreme left is no longer represented by a single major party but by a broader and more fragmented coalition of parties under the banner of the New Popular Front (Documents 4, 8, 11).\n3.  **Overall Seat Count:** While the traditional PCF has declined, the overall number of seats held by the broader radical and far-left has increased. In 1973, they held 76 seats (~15.5% of the assembly). In 2024, the combined seats of LFI (75), PCF (9), the Left Party (20), and smaller far-left parties (like NPA, POI, MDES, EH Bai) total well over 100 seats, constituting a larger share (over 19%) of the modern 577-seat assembly.",

Document 2, which lists the members of this bloc, confirms that all 19 deputies are from Christian sects (Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, and Armenian Orthodox).\n*   **Strong Lebanon (13 seats):** This bloc is led by the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), which is a predominantly Christian party.\n*   **Kataeb Representatives (4 seats):** This bloc consists of the Kataeb Party, which is described as having a \"Mostly Christianity\" religious affiliation and a focus on \"Maronite politics\" (Document 4). Document 9 confirms its four deputies are Maronite.\n*   **Independent National Bloc (3 seats):** This bloc is led by the Marada Movement, a Christian party (Document 6).\n*   **Armenian Bloc of Representatives (2 seats):** This bloc represents Armenian Christian interests, with both seats held by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) (Document 1).\n\n**Total for major Christian blocs: 19 + 13 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 41 seats.**\n\n### Shia Muslim Faction\n\nThe Shia faction is represented by two major political blocs:\n*   **Loyalty to the Resistance (15 seats):** This bloc is led by Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist party.\n*   **Development and Liberation (15 seats):** This bloc is led by the Amal Movement, a major Shia political party. The Parliament Speaker, Nabih Berri, is from this movement (Document 1).\n\n**Total for major Shia blocs: 15 + 15 = 30 seats.**\n\n### Druze Faction\n\nThe Druze faction's representation is primarily through one main bloc:\n*   **Democratic Gathering (8 seats):** This bloc is led by the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), whose confessional base is the Druze sect (Document 3).\n\n**Total for major Druze bloc: 8 seats.**\n\n### Sunni Muslim Faction\n\nThe documents show that Sunni political parties are more fragmented and do not form a single large bloc comparable to the Christian or Shia factions. Sunni parties mentioned include the Islamic Group (1 seat), and parties within smaller mixed blocs like Renewal (NDP and Sanad Movement) and National Compatibility (Al-Ahbash and Dignity Movement).\n\nIn conclusion, by summing the seats of the major political blocs that are organized along confessional lines, the Christian faction holds a total of at least 41 seats, which is more than any other single religious faction in the Lebanese parliament.",

      "llm_response": "Yes, based on the provided documents, the suffragette movement can be considered a precursor to and a fundamental part of the feminist movement. In fact, it is identified as the first major phase of feminism.\n\nHere is a summary of the evidence from the documents:\n\n*   **The Suffragette Movement is the First Wave of Feminism:** Document 5 explicitly states that \"the First Wave of Feminism, known as the Suffragette Movement, began on 19‚Äì20 July 1848 during the first Women's Right Convention in Seneca Falls, New York.\" This directly identifies the movement not just as a precursor but as the initial stage of the feminist movement itself.\n\n*   **Shared Goals:** The feminist movement is defined as a series of campaigns for reforms on women's issues, one of which is \"women's suffrage\" (Document 2). The suffragette movement's specific purpose was to secure \"Votes for Women\" (Documents 1 and 4). This shows a clear overlap in objectives, with the suffragettes focusing on a key goal that is central to the broader feminist agenda.\n\n*   **Broader Aims Beyond Voting:** The early suffragette movement, as part of the First Wave of Feminism, had aims beyond just the right to vote. The 1848 Seneca Falls Convention's \"Declaration of Sentiments\" called for \"equal rights for women and men on the basis of education, right to property, organizational leadership, right to vote, and marital freedoms\" (Document 5). This demonstrates that the movement was rooted in a wider demand for equality, which is the core principle of feminism.\n\n*   **Historical Timeline:** The feminist movement is noted to have begun in the 1800s (Document 2). The start of the First Wave, or the Suffragette Movement, is dated to the Seneca Falls convention in 1848 (Document 5), which was sparked by women being excluded from the World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 (Document 6). This historical progression places the fight for suffrage at the very beginning of the organized feminist movement.",

For these novels, no plot summary is provided in the documents, but their titles indicate a setting entirely outside of England, and no other information contradicts this.\n\nThe seven novels are:\n1.  **The Murder on the Links**: The title suggests a setting in France, where the story is famously set. The documents provide no information placing any action in England.\n2.  **The Mystery of the Blue Train**: The title refers to Le Train Bleu, which ran from Calais to the French Riviera, placing the action in France. The documents do not mention any scenes in England.\n3.  **Murder on the Orient Express**: The title refers to the train service that ran across continental Europe. The documents do not provide a plot summary but give no indication of any action taking place in England.\n4.  **Murder in Mesopotamia**: The title explicitly places the setting in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq).\n5.  **Death on the Nile**: The title places the setting on the Nile River in Egypt.\n6.  **They Came to Baghdad**: The title places the setting in Baghdad, Iraq.\n7.  **A Caribbean Mystery**: The title places the setting in the Caribbean.\n\nFor numerous other novels, the provided documents contain plot summaries that explicitly place at least part of the action in England. For example, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles* is set in Essex (Document 2), *The Secret Adversary* is set in London (Document 3), and *Death in the Clouds* involves a flight to London's Croydon Airport (Document 13). Novels like *Hallowe'en Party* are also confirmed to be set in England, as its film adaptation was \"relocated from England\" (Document 41).
