There isn’t evidence here that right‑wing parties “tend” to have more women leaders than left‑wing parties; leadership by women varies by country and party family, and men still lead most major parties overall.",

      "llm_response": "Short answer: It rose from a small minority early in the 1900s to a plurality/majority of winners by the late 20th century, and while still the single largest national share in the 21st century, it has eased somewhat as awards have diversified geographically.\n\nEvidence from the provided lists and country tallies:\n- Early 20th century: Few Americans appear among the many Nobel awards each year (for example, Theodore Roosevelt, Peace 1906; Albert A. Michelson, Physics 1907), so the American share was low in the 1900s–1910s (Document 3).  \n- Post–World War II through the late 20th century: The U.S. share climbs sharply. Across many years in the 1940s–1990s, multiple Americans win in the same year and across several fields (see the 1944 winners including U.S. laureates in Physics and Medicine, Documents 4, 7; the long run of U.S. winners listed year by year in Document 3).\n- By field, the U.S. becomes dominant in several prizes, underscoring the overall rise in share by the late 20th century:\n  - Physics: United States has the most laureates (91) (Document 17).\n  - Economics (since 1969): United States has a very large share (71 laureates) (Document 58).\n  - Peace: United States leads with 23 laureates (Document 13).\n  - Literature: United States is tied near the top with 13 laureates (Document 22).\n- 21st century: Americans still win many prizes each year (e.g., 2000s–2020s entries in Document 3), but there is visibly broader country distribution (for example, 2020s awards include EU and Asian laureates alongside Americans). Even so, U.S. winners continue to appear frequently in Physics (e.g., John Clauser 2022), Chemistry (e.g., Carolyn Bertozzi 2022; Jennifer Doudna 2020), Medicine (e.g., Harvey J. Alter and Charles M. Rice 2020), Economics (e.g., multiple U.S. laureates in 2020–2023), and Literature (Louise Glück 2020) (Documents 3, 17, 22, 56, 194, 201).\n\nWhat this implies about the “annual average percentage” over the past century:\n- 1900s–1930s: low single-digit to low teens percent of total laureates per year were American (qualitatively, based on sparse U.S. entries in early years; see Document 3).\n- 1940s–1990s: steady rise to a very high share; by late 20th century Americans often constituted a very large fraction of annual laureates (supported by U.S. dominance in Physics and the Economics prize after 1969, Documents 17 and 58, and numerous U.S. winners per year in Document 3).\n- 2000s–2020s: still the largest national share, though somewhat lower than the late‑20th‑century peak as awards have diversified across Europe and Asia; nonetheless, the U.S. continues to lead counts in several fields (Documents 17, 58, 13, 22 and the 2001–2024 rows in Document 3).\n\nIn sum: the American share of Nobel laureates increased dramatically from the early 20th century, peaked around the late 20th century (often approaching or exceeding about half in some years/fields), and has dipped modestly in the 21st century while remaining the largest national share.",

For the House of Plantagenet, the correct answer specifies the Treaty of Wallingford arrangement that made Henry Plantagenet heir; the response instead assigns that mechanism to the Angevins and gives only a stylistic note for Plantagenet. For the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the correct answer says Edward VII named the royal house after his father, whereas the response only notes his paternal line without the naming action. The response also includes an extra dynasty (House of Normandy) not in the correct answer. These discrepancies mean the response does not fully match the correct_answer.\n\ncorrect: no\n\noverlapping answers: ###House of Blois###Angevins###House of Capet###House of Plantagenet###House of Lancaster###House of York###House of Tudor###House of Stuart###House of Hanover###House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha###House of Windsor###",

      "llm_response": "Below are the main antagonists named or clearly implied in the provided documents, with their motivations (and a brief pointer to the evidence).\n\nTragedies\n- Hamlet — King Claudius: Ambition to seize and secure the Danish throne; he murdered his brother (King Hamlet) and married Gertrude to obtain and keep power (Documents 17, 44).\n- King Lear — Edmund: Resentment at being illegitimate and ruthless ambition “to get rid of his brother, then his father, and become Earl in his own right” (Documents 18, 45).\n- Othello — Iago: Hatred of Othello; he seeks to destroy him by making him believe Desdemona is unfaithful with Cassio (Document 19).\n- Julius Caesar — Cassius (leader of the conspiracy; with Brutus): To stop Caesar from becoming a tyrant and to defend the Republic (Document 48).\n- Macbeth — (not detailed in the supplied documents; Macduff is identified as the heroic protagonist opposing Macbeth: Document 28).\n- Antony and Cleopatra — Octavius Caesar: Political ambition and consolidation of power over Rome against Antony (Documents 20, 53).\n- Coriolanus — The Roman tribunes and Aufidius (as opposing forces): Political hostility to Coriolanus’s patrician contempt; they engineer his banishment; Aufidius seeks military/personal revenge against his Roman rival (Document 24).\n- Titus Andronicus — Aaron (with Demetrius and Chiron): Malicious scheming to ruin Titus; incites rape/murder and frames Titus’s sons (Document 25).\n- Timon of Athens — Timon’s parasitic “friends” and creditors: Greed and self-interest; they flatter to take his money, then abandon and dun him when he is ruined (Documents 26, 54).\n- Cymbeline — Iachimo: Pride and wagering; he aims to win a bet by “proving” Imogen’s infidelity, then deceives to save face and gain advantage (Document 29).\n- Troilus and Cressida — (no antagonist identified in the supplied documents).\n- Romeo and Juliet — Key antagonistic forces: the family feud; and specifically Lord Capulet’s coercive parental authority—he forces Juliet toward Paris, motivated by his belief he knows best and (misguidedly) to “cheer her” after Tybalt’s death, demanding obedience (Documents 16, 43).\n\nComedies and Romances\n- Measure for Measure — Angelo (main antagonist): Motivated by hypocritical moral zeal and abuse of power (Document 6).\n- Much Ado About Nothing — Don John: Malice/jealousy; he “uses” situations “to sow chaos,” slandering Hero to nearly ruin her marriage to Claudio (Documents 7, 31).\n- The Merchant of Venice — Shylock: Resentment and revenge against Antonio’s antisemitic abuse and undercutting of his trade; insists on the pound-of-flesh bond (Documents 55, 36).\n- A Midsummer Night’s Dream — Egeus (antagonistic force at the start): Paternal authority; he invokes Athenian law to force Hermia to marry Demetrius or face death/claustration (Document 35).\n- Twelfth Night — Malvolio: Puritanical self-righteousness and social ambition; he despises revelry and behaves foolishly when he thinks Olivia loves him, clashing with the merrymakers (Documents 49, 38).\n- The Winter’s Tale — Leontes (his jealousy functions as the antagonist): Irrational jealousy; he persecutes Hermione and Polixenes, refuses the Oracle, and only repents after tragedy (Documents 39, 8).\n- All’s Well That Ends Well — Bertram (antagonistic spouse): Class pride and rejection of Helena; he is “indifferent to her” and resists the marriage she wins by curing the King (Document 50).\n- The Merry Wives of Windsor — Falstaff (comic antagonist): Lust/avarice; he tries to seduce two married women for pleasure and profit (Documents 30, 5).\n- The Comedy of Errors — No true villain; conflict springs from mistaken identity and ensuing confusions (Document 58).\n- Love’s Labour’s Lost — No clear antagonist; the conflicts arise from the men’s oath and their own self-deception (Documents 22, 47).\n- Pericles, Prince of Tyre — Antiochus: To conceal his incest with his daughter; he kills failed suitors and even sends an assassin after Pericles (Documents 40, 9).\n- The Two Noble Kinsmen — Creon of Thebes: Tyranny/cruelty; he has killed the queens’ husbands and refuses them burial (Document 10).\n\nHistories\n- Richard II — Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV): To reclaim his confiscated lands and seize the crown, i.e., political ambition (Document 12).\n- King John — King Philip of France and the papal legate Pandolf (as opposing forces): To press Arthur’s claim to the English throne by primogeniture; later, English nobles turn against John believing he murdered Arthur (Documents 32, 11).\n- Henry IV, Part 1 — Rebel lords (Worcester, Northumberland, Hotspur): Political rebellion against Henry IV (Document 57).\n- Henry IV, Part 2 — Archbishop Scrope and allied rebels: Political grievances/demands (they are induced to disband on promises, then arrested) (Document 59).\n- Henry V — The Dauphin and France: National/political opposition to Henry’s claim; the Dauphin’s scornful insult (tennis balls) signals contempt and hostility (Document 13).\n- Henry VI, Part 1 — The Dauphin Charles and the French rebels: To expel the English and recover France (Document 14).\n- Henry VI, Part 2 — The Duke of York (rising): To advance his claim and power against a weak king; the play charts his rise toward open conflict (Document 52).\n- Henry VI, Part 3 — No single antagonist; both sides perpetrate atrocities in the raw pursuit of power (Document 23).\n- Edward III — The French king and Scots as opposing forces: To defend their thrones/claims against Edward’s invasion (Documents 15, 42).\n- Henry VIII — Cardinal Wolsey (the play’s “villain”): Self-aggrandizement; abuses taxation “for his own purposes,” manipulates credit and arrests, and grabs credit for the King’s decisions (Documents 33, 21).\n\nNotes\n- Where the documents explicitly identify the antagonist or their acts, I cited them directly.

Several listed motivations also conflict with the precise motivations in the correct_answer (e.g., Merry Wives, Othello, All’s Well, Julius Caesar).\n\ncorrect: no\n\noverlapping answers: ###Much Ado About Nothing — Don John: Malice/jealousy; he “uses” situations “to sow chaos,” slandering Hero to nearly ruin her marriage to Claudio.###The Two Noble Kinsmen — Creon of Thebes: Tyranny/cruelty; he has killed the queens’ husbands and refuses them burial.###The Winter’s Tale — Leontes (his jealousy functions as the antagonist): Irrational jealousy; he persecutes Hermione and Polixenes, refuses the Oracle, and only repents after tragedy.###Richard II — Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV): To reclaim his confiscated lands and seize the crown, i.e., political ambition.###Henry V — The Dauphin and France: National/political opposition to Henry’s claim; the Dauphin’s scornful insult (tennis balls) signals contempt and hostility.###Henry VI, Part 1 — The Dauphin Charles and the French rebels: To expel the English and recover France.###Romeo and Juliet — Key antagonistic forces: the family feud; and specifically Lord Capulet’s coercive parental authority—he forces Juliet toward Paris, motivated by his belief he knows best and (misguidedly) to “cheer her” after Tybalt’s death, demanding obedience.###Hamlet — King Claudius: Ambition to seize and secure the Danish throne; he murdered his brother (King Hamlet) and married Gertrude to obtain and keep power.###King Lear — Edmund: Resentment at being illegitimate and ruthless ambition “to get rid of his brother, then his father, and become Earl in his own right”.###Titus Andronicus — Aaron (with Demetrius and Chiron): Malicious scheming to ruin Titus; incites rape/murder and frames Titus’s sons.###Twelfth Night — Malvolio: Puritanical self-righteousness and social ambition; he despises revelry and behaves foolishly when he thinks Olivia loves him, clashing with the merrymakers.###Timon of Athens — Timon’s parasitic “friends” and creditors: Greed and self-interest; they flatter to take his money, then abandon and dun him when he is ruined.###A Midsummer Night’s Dream — Egeus (antagonistic force at the start): Paternal authority; he invokes Athenian law to force Hermia to marry Demetrius or face death/claustration.###The Merchant of Venice — Shylock: Resentment and revenge against Antonio’s antisemitic abuse and undercutting of his trade; insists on the pound-of-flesh bond.###Henry VI, Part 2 — The Duke of York (rising): To advance his claim and power against a weak king; the play charts his rise toward open conflict.###Henry IV, Part 1 — Rebel lords (Worcester, Northumberland, Hotspur): Political rebellion against Henry IV.###King John — King Philip of France and the papal legate Pandolf (as opposing forces): To press Arthur’s claim to the English throne by primogeniture; later, English nobles turn against John believing he murdered Arthur.###Henry VIII — Cardinal Wolsey (the play’s “villain”): Self-aggrandizement; abuses taxation “for his own purposes,” manipulates credit and arrests, and grabs credit for the King’s decisions.",

Many items differ in cause of death or duration (e.g., Romulus Augustulus listed as “deposed and retired; 10m 4d” vs. 0 years in the correct_answer; Tacitus listed as “illness or murdered; c. 7 months” vs. an unrelated note with 0; Probus listed as ~6 years in the response vs. “3 months” in the correct_answer).

A doublet was a buttoned jacket that was generally of hip length. A robe, tunic, or kirtle was usually worn over the shirt or doublet, over this, a man might also wear an over-kirtle, cloak, or a hood. the chaperon made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings."

Trousers were tailored either loose or tight (or not worn at all if the weather was warm). Leggings were strips of cloth wound round the leg, held in place by long laces. A cloak or mantle, fastened by a brooch, completed the outfit. For headgear, the cappa or chaperon was a one-piece hood and cape over the shoulders was worn for cold weather, and the Roman straw hat for summer fieldwork. Shoes, were mostly the simple turnshoe of a cowhide sole and softer leather upper, which were sewn together, and then turned inside out."

Tailored cloth leggings called chausses or hose, made as separate garments for each leg, the hose became longer and more fitting and reached above the knees. Over the undertunic and hose, men wore an outer tunic that reached to the knees or ankles, and that was fastened at the waist with a belt. Fitted bliauts, of wool or, increasingly, silk, had sleeves that were cut wide at the wrist and gored skirts. Men wore bliauts open to the waist front and back or at the side seams. The newly introduced doublet and the quilted and padded jupe or gipon were short, fitted garments for the upper body, worn under the tunic. The sleeveless surcoat or cyclas was introduced as protective covering for armour. Rectangular and circular cloaks were worn over the tunic, fastened on the right shoulder or at the center front. As headgear, the chaperon in the form of hood and attached shoulder-length cape was worn, as well as the fitted linen coif tied under the chin. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer."

One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head, where the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a garnache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardecorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A mantle was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, shoes, and headdress. Men wore long braies or leggings with legs of varying length. Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the beret, the coif (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat, and a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders. Shoes were slightly pointed, and embroidered for royalty and higher clergy."

Over the shirt was worn a doublet, very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, with the sleeves being full and even puffy. Men wore short braies or breeches, a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt. Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored. As doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the codpiece. The Houppelande, or cioppa, was the overgarment of the wealthy, it was a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ-pipe pleats and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor. A sideless tunic or tabard, called a giornea or journade was popular. For headgear, the hood remained popular, although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into a chaperon. Hats began to compete with the chaperon. Hats of vaious styles: tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all, hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif, or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front. For footwear the duckbill shoe and long-toed poulaines were popular."

Quitting smoking lowers the chance of developing lung cancer and improves outcomes if cancer occurs (Document 5).\n\n- Cervical cancer:\n  - Regular screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test every 3–5 years, with appropriate follow‑up; this has dramatically reduced cases and mortality and can cut incidence by up to 80%.

With progression, may cause trouble urinating (frequency, weak/slow stream), blood in urine or semen, and erectile dysfunction (Doc 3).\n- Colorectal cancer: Can be asymptomatic in many (around 50%). Early signs/symptoms may include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits (e.g., worsening constipation, decreased stool caliber), abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss; rectal bleeding or iron-deficiency anemia are high-risk features, particularly in people over 50 (Docs 4, 9, 11).\n- Stomach (gastric) cancer: Frequently asymptomatic or nonspecific early. Early symptoms can include heartburn, bloating, upper abdominal pain, nausea, belching, and loss of appetite; some may have unexplained nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/constipation (Docs 5, 10, 12).\n\nWomen\n- Breast cancer: Not covered in the provided documents (no early-symptom details available here).\n- Colorectal cancer: As above—often no symptoms early; possible early signs include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight/appetite loss; rectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk, especially over age 50 (Docs 4, 9, 11).\n- Lung cancer: As above—often no early symptoms; possible new/worsening cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, persistent chest pain; systemic symptoms can include appetite/weight loss, weakness, fever, night sweats (Docs 7, 2).\n- Cervical cancer: Early stages may have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they often include vaginal bleeding (especially after sexual intercourse, douching, or a pelvic exam), vaginal discharge, and pain during sexual intercourse; pelvic pain is more typical later (Docs 6, 8).",

For colorectal cancer, it does not include “nausea in someone over 50” and “vomiting in someone over 50,” and it does not specify the associations with rectal bleeding as in the correct_answer.

The PCF itself has shrunk to roughly 8–9 deputies (Documents 8 and 11).\n\n- In short: representation has shifted from a strong Communist bloc in the 1970s to a larger but reconfigured radical left led by LFI today, while the Communists’ share has markedly declined.",

Notched lapels on double‑breasted jackets are rare (Documents 2 and 3).\n\n- Peaked lapel: More formal. Nearly always used on double‑breasted jackets, though also seen on single‑breasted suits. Appropriate when a sharper, more formal look is desired, especially on double‑breasted styles (Document 2).\n\n- Shawl lapel: A continuous, curved lapel. Usually found on dinner jackets/tuxedos and mess jackets; associated with eveningwear. Originated on smoking jackets and remains standard for black‑tie contexts (Documents 2 and 4).\nfinal answer length: 3\nreasoning: The response lists the same three lapel styles and matches their appropriate use: Notched as standard on single-breasted and most jackets; Peaked as more formal, nearly always on double-breasted but also on single-breasted; Shawl for dinner jackets/tuxedos.

It omits required pairs (e.g., Algeria - Arabs, Algeria - Berbers), includes many countries marked “Not specified,” and diverges in several cases (e.g., Namibia not listed though correct_answer includes detailed groups; Ivory Coast groups not aligned with “Dyula, Maninka”; Mozambique lists “Tsonga/Shangaan” but not both separately). It also mixes broader racial categories for South Africa rather than ethnic groups, and excludes some entries that the correct_answer requires (e.g., Madeira, Ceuta, Melilla), while including others not in the correct_answer. Therefore, it is not equivalent to the correct_answer.\n\ncorrect: no\n\noverlapping answers: ###Egypt - Ethnic Egyptians###Libya - Arab###Morocco - Arabs###Morocco - Berbers###Western Sahara - Arab###Western Sahara -

High risk of liver changes/hepatotoxicity and psychiatric effects (depression, anxiety, fatigue) also noted (Doc 1).\n\nTopical potassium‑channel opener\n- Minoxidil\n  - Topical: eye itching, general itching, local scalp irritation, and unwanted hair growth elsewhere (hypertrichosis) (Doc 21).\n  - Oral (off‑label at low dose in some): swelling of face/extremities, rapid heartbeat, lightheadedness; cardiac lesions seen in animals; very rare pseudoacromegaly at large doses (Doc 11).\n\nAntifungal/other agents used in hair loss care\n- Ketoconazole\n  - Topical: skin redness (Doc 9).\n  - Oral: nausea, headache, serious liver problems (including liver failure or need for transplant), QT prolongation, adrenocortical insufficiency, anaphylaxis (Doc 9).\n\nGeneral antiandrogen class effects (context)\n- In males: demasculinization/feminization (breast pain/gynecomastia, reduced body hair, decreased muscle mass, fat redistribution), hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, infertility, osteoporosis, depression, fatigue, anemia; unfavorable lipid changes possible long‑term (Docs 12, 22).\n- In premenopausal women, antiandrogens that suppress androgen production can lower estrogen and cause hot flashes, menstrual irregularities, and osteoporosis (Docs 12, 22).\n\nOcular prostaglandin analogs used for eyelash growth (if considered “hair loss” therapies)\n- Bimatoprost: conjunctival hyperemia (>10%), blurred vision, redness, burning/discomfort, permanent iris darkening; occasional headache and nausea (Doc 5).\n- Latanoprost: blurred/stinging/burning, conjunctival hyperemia, iris pigmentation; less common systemic or severe ocular events reported (Doc 10).\n\nfinal answer length: 105\n\nreasoning: The response includes many side effects that match the correct list, but it also contains multiple items not in the correct_answer (e.g., insomnia, cognitive issues, decreased sperm motility, increased sebum production, interference with male fetal development, QT prolongation, anaphylaxis). Additionally, several items present in the correct_answer are missing from the response (e.g., intraoperative floppy iris syndrome, cataract formation, self-harm, dementia, ejaculatory dysfunction, various detailed ocular complications).

Filipino Americans’ religion is listed as “Not specified” instead of Christianity. Vietnamese Americans include Vietnamese as a language and list Buddhism at 37% (not 43%), which exceeds the allowed error margin and adds extra religions; the correct_answer specifies English with Buddhism (43%). Indian Americans list many languages (e.g., Hindi-Urdu, Telugu, etc.) rather than Hindi alone as in the correct_answer, causing mismatches across all Indian entries. While Korean Americans and Japanese Americans’ language-religion pairs align with the correct_answer, the overall set still diverges materially.

A Roman relief army under Litorius (with Hunnic allies) routed the Visigoths and lifted the siege, so the Visigoths were unsuccessful (Documents 1, 6, 7).\n\n- Siege of Narbonne (737): The Franks under Charles Martel besieged Narbonne to take it from the Umayyad garrison. They defeated a relieving Arab‑Berber force at the River Berre but did not capture the city; the siege was militarily successful but politically inconclusive, and the city did not fall (Document 2).\n\n- Siege of Narbonne (752–759): The Franks (with Septimanian Visigoth support) besieged Narbonne again, this time successfully. In 759 they took the city; the result was a decisive Frankish victory and the expulsion of the Arab‑Berber garrison (Documents 3, 5).\n\n- Battle of Narbonne (763): This was a battle between Francia and the Duchy of Aquitaine near/at Narbonne resulting in a Frankish victory. The provided text does not state that either side was attempting to capture the city in this engagement, only that the Franks won the battle (Document 4).",

        "Yam khai dao"
      ],
      "llm_response": "Short answer: None of the salads listed are strictly vegetarian in their usual/traditional form. Many Thai “yam” and “tam” salads use fish sauce and/or dried seafood by default, and several include meat or seafood outright. However, a few are relatively easy to order or prepare vegetarian (or ovo‑vegetarian) if you ask to omit fish sauce, shrimp paste, dried shrimp, anchovies/crab, etc. (Docs 1, 3, 4, 26; vegetarian definitions in Docs 5–6).\n\nVegetarian‑friendly (with common modifications noted)\n- Som tam (green papaya salad) and Som tam khai khem (salted‑egg variation): Typically include fish sauce and often dried shrimp/fish paste (Doc 3), but can be made vegetarian by omitting these; the salted‑egg version suits ovo‑vegetarians (Docs 1, 3, 5).\n- Tam makhuea (northern grilled eggplant salad): The version shown includes hard‑boiled egg (Doc 1), but northern recipes commonly add fish and shrimp paste (Doc 4). It can be ovo‑vegetarian if those are left out (Docs 1, 4, 5).\n- Yam khai dao (fried‑egg salad): Ovo‑vegetarian if the dressing is made without fish sauce, which yams “nearly always” include unless you request otherwise (Docs 1, 26, 5).\n- Yam hua pli thot (banana blossom salad): Plant‑based main ingredient; ask for no fish sauce in the yam‑style dressing (Docs 1, 26).\n- Yam bai cha (tea‑leaf salad): Plant‑based main ingredient; ask for no fish sauce (Docs 1, 26).\n- Tam maphrao on sen mi krop (young coconut with crispy rice noodles): Plant‑based main ingredients; ask for no fish sauce (Docs 1, 26).\n- Khao yam (Thai rice salad): Can be vegetarian, but the version shown contains dried shrimp flakes (Doc 1). Request a version without shrimp and without fish sauce.\n\nNot vegetarian as listed (examples)\n- Som tam pu (with brined crabs) and Tam maak hoong (often with fermented fish and brined crabs) (Doc 1; also see typical som tam additions in Doc 3).\n- Tam mamuang and Yam som‑o versions shown with anchovies and fish sauce (Doc 1).\n- Yam no mai includes fish sauce (Doc 1).\n- Fruit “tam” (Tam phonlamai ruam) includes dried shrimp and fish sauce (Doc 1).\n- All meat/seafood yams and phla/lap/nam tok entries (e.g., pork, beef, prawns, cockles, catfish, mixed seafood) are not vegetarian (Doc 1).\n\nWhy the modifications are needed\n- Yam dressings “nearly always contain … fish sauce” (Doc 26).\n- Som tam commonly includes fish sauce, dried shrimp, shrimp/fish pastes (Doc 3).\n- Northern tam makhuea traditionally uses fish and shrimp paste (Doc 4).\n- Ovo‑vegetarian options can include eggs but still must avoid fish/seafood products (Docs 5–6).\n\nIn practice: the most vegetarian‑friendly choices to order are plant/egg‑based salads such as Som tam (or Som tam khai khem), Tam makhuea, Yam khai dao, Yam hua pli thot, Yam bai cha, and Tam maphrao on sen mi krop—provided you specify no fish sauce, no shrimp/fish paste, and no dried shrimp/anchovies/crab.",
