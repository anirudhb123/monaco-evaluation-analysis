# MoNaCo: More Natural and Complex Questions for Reasoning Across Dozens of Documents

<img align="left" src="images/monaco_logo.jpeg" style="width:20%; height:auto;"></img>
MoNaCo is a human written benchmark of natural complex questions annotated with their full reasoning chains, intermediate questions, answers and evidence. MoNaCo has 1,315 complex questions with each question requiring evidence from 44.3 different Wiki pages on average.
This repository hosts the MoNaCo website and leaderboard.
